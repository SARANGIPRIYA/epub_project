<p class="noindent">This book describes and explains some of the investigative methods employed to determine why and how a particular event occurred. The usual terms of art to describe this activity include <i>root cause investigation</i>, <i>root cause analysis</i>, <i>failure analysis</i>, <i>forensic investigation</i>, <i>forensic engineering</i>, <i>accident reconstruction, failure reconstruction, failure investigation,</i> and so on. While there are different shades of meaning among the terms, and various trades and professional groups have their favorite terms, they all embrace determining how and why an event occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, this book is fundamentally about investigating cause- and-effect relationships. Given the end result, that is, the effect, this book describes some of the systematic methods employed to determine the event&#x2019; s cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually the effect to be investigated is something bad: an accident, a failure, a catastrophic event, or a crime. Investigations, however, don&#x2019; t have to include only events that are bad. There is certainly value in understanding clearly how things are accomplished successfully. Unfortunately, while it is common to investigate the reasons why something bad has occurred, to determine who or what was at fault, the reasons for successful results are often taken for granted.</p>
<p class="indent">When a part, component, material, system, procedure, or management method appears to work well in one situation, but inexplicably fails when applied elsewhere, the reason it was successful in the first place was likely not clearly understood. The cause for success in the first case may have been presumed rather than proven by rigorous assessment of the evidence. Thus, the lack of accurate knowledge about why the part, component, material, system, procedure, or management method was successful in the first situation prevented potential failures in other applications from being predictable and avoidable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_2" aria-label=" Page 2. "/>Most failure or accident investigations begin at the end of the story: after the explosion, after the fire has been extinguished, after the collapse, and so on. It is at this point that people ask: How did this happen, and who or what is to blame for this? From this chronological endpoint, the investigator gathers, verifies, and assesses evidence to determine how and why the event came to occur.</p>
<p class="indent">In many instances, information about both the last event and the starting event is known reasonably well. Information about what occurred between these endpoints, however, is often unclear, confusing, and perhaps even contradictory. The intermediate points usually reveal themselves in a piecemeal fashion as evidence is gathered and assessed.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">Some evidence items, of course, are not time and date stamped for the convenience of the investigator. Their place in the event sequence must be deduced or inferred by statements, context, and logic.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Then again, some items are indeed time and date stamped, such as bills of lading, credit card receipts, money machine receipts, e-mail, or postmarked letters. These items often serve as verifiable anchor points in a timeline.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Some presumed evidence items are simply red herrings. In the end, they are found to have no significant relationship to the event being investigated. These items may at first appear to be related to the event, or someone may claim they are related to the event. Red herrings can cost an investigator valuable time and resources to validate that they are unimportant. However, if they are not properly investigated and found out, they can cause the final conclusions of the investigation to be significantly flawed.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Some important evidence items may never be discovered at all. They may have been inadvertently discarded during the investigation or cleanup, lost, deliberately destroyed to conceal the true cause of the event by the perpetrator or accomplice, or perhaps destroyed by the event itself. Consider the paper match that ignites a forest fire.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Some evidence may be misinterpreted by the investigator. Perhaps its significance is overlooked, overvalued, or not understood properly at all. For example, the significance of material fatigue may not be properly evaluated if the investigators cannot recognize what a fatigue fracture looks like.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Some evidence items may be deliberate falsifications. Such items may not be a natural precursor, result, or consequence of the event. They may have been deliberately positioned at the accident scene, or within the evidence trail, to be discovered by the investigator. They are intended to mislead the investigator and cause him to reach an incorrect conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_3" aria-label=" Page 3. "/>In any case, it is the investigator&#x2019;s job to assess, sort, and piece the evidentiary pieces into a logical, coherent story of how and why the event came to pass. Like solving a puzzle that has some missing pieces, and perhaps a few extra pieces thrown in from other puzzles, the investigator considers each piece of evidence many times and in different combinations to determine where it fits in the overall picture.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, in a car accident between cars A and B, the positions where the vehicles and the accident victims came to rest will usually be well known. This is the endpoint of the timeline. The relative positions of the vehicles and participants prior to the accident, that is, the starting point, may also be known. For example, car A was heading west on Elm Street with Joe and Jim in it, and car B was heading north on 2nd Street with Mr. and Mrs. Smith in it. The investigator then fills in what occurred between the start point and the endpoint on the timeline.</p>
<p class="indent">Witnesses may document some parts of the story in statements, and the participants may document some parts of the story in statements. Unfortunately, the various statements will likely conflict with one another, lack detail, contain convenient exaggerations or understatements, contain ill-formed conclusions or personal theories disguised as observations, or be incomplete. The gaps in information, the resolution of conflicting information, the degree of exaggeration and understatement, and the discrimination between ill-formed conclusions and actual observations are arbitrated by the physical evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, some important condition completely unknown to any of the witnesses or participants may come to light if the investigation is thorough and unbiased. For example, a mechanical problem in one of the vehicles that was unknown to any witness or participant might have played a significant role in the accident, perhaps by slightly lengthening the stopping distance of the vehicle. Perhaps the timing of the traffic lights was inappropriate because not enough time for the yellow light was allowed. Perhaps the intersection itself was poorly designed for the amount of traffic being borne, or the speed limit was posted 10 mph too high. It is surprising how many &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; cause determinations based upon witness statements are readily overturned by just a modest amount of investigation into the physical evidence and facts.</p>
<p class="indent">Eyewitnesses usually do not see or perceive latent deficiencies. They are poor judges of time, distance, loudness, brightness, and temperature. They often focus on the immediate accident event, which is noisy and attention getting, to the exclusion of other events and circumstances that existed in the immediate area at the same time. These other events may have occurred with less fanfare but may have been more significant with respect to the causation of the accident event.</p>
<p class="indent">Houdini and Blackstone are famous for expertly creating diversions to pleasantly misdirect thousands of eyewitnesses all at the same time.Some <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_4" aria-label=" Page 4. "/>audience members were so convinced by the stage illusions that they believed they had seen &#x201C;the real thing.&#x201D; As these famous magicians knew:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">Eyewitnesses tend to see what they already understand and wish to see.</li>
<li class="dotch01">They don&#x2019;t see what they don&#x2019;t understand and don&#x2019;t want to know.</li>
<li class="dotch01">They tend to focus on what is bright, colorful, sexy, and noisy and ignore what is quiet, bland, and unobtrusive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Eyewitnesses often do not directly report their observations. They tend to report their personal conclusions as they internally try to make sense of what they have observed. It is a natural tendency of people to try to make sense of disconnected events they have observed and &#x201C;connect the dots.&#x201D; Over time, as they think about things and listen to the comments of friends and neighbors, they often report having seen things that they did not actually witness. Likewise, over time they may forget things that they may have actually witnessed. They remember what they think is interesting or what other people think is interesting, and forget what they think is unimportant.</p>
<p class="indent">And, of course, some witnesses simply lie. They lie perhaps for sport, perhaps for attention or self-amusement, or perhaps for the power over the situation that the lie can bring about. Often, however, they simply lie for personal gain.</p>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_2">What a Failure Investigator Does</h2>
<p class="noindent">Like a good journalist, a failure investigator endeavors to determine who, what, when, where, why, and how. When a particular failure, crime, or event has been explained, when the sequence of events has been determined, and when the main questions about causation have been answered, it is said that the event, failure, or crime has been solved or reconstructed.</p>
<p class="indent">To establish a sound basis for analysis, an investigator relies upon the actual physical evidence found at the scene and verifiable facts and records related to the matter. The investigator then applies accepted methodologies and well-proven scientific principles to organize and interpret the physical evidence and facts. The investigator compares the facts and analytic results to the various statements by witnesses and participants. Facts and physical evidence place limits on what actually occurred. Like a mathematical inequality or limit, they bound what is possible and what is not possible. If the statement by a witness does not fit within these limits, it should not be trusted.</p>
<p class="indent">For example,suppose that a particular type of subcompact car was involved in an accident. When brand new and driven by a professional driver, the car is capable of accelerating no faster than 6.5 ft/s<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 60 mph. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_5" aria-label=" Page 5. "/>was reported by an eyewitness that the car was stopped at a red light. After the light turned green, the car then drove a short distance and passed by the eyewitness. The roadway is level. The eyewitness reported that the car flew by him and was going at least 60 mph when it passed him. Actual measurements of the distance from where the witness was standing at the time to where the car had been stopped for the red light indicate 200 ft. Should you, as the investigator, accept what the eyewitness reported?</p>
<p class="indent">The application of some basic physics indicates the following. Sixty miles per hour is equal to 88 ft/s. If a car accelerates at 6.5 ft/s<sup>2</sup>, it will take 13.54 s to reach 88 ft/s. At this acceleration and lapsed time, the distance needed to accelerate to 88 ft/s is 596 ft. Consequently, the car cannot physically reach a speed of 60 mph in 200 ft. In fact, under the best circumstance, the top speed that the car can reach in 200 ft is 51 ft/s, or 34.8 mph. Because the driver was not a professional and the car had 90,000 miles on it, the actual speed that the car could attain in 200 ft was likely less than 34.8 mph. Consequently, the speed estimate reported by the eyewitness cannot be correct no matter how sincere and convincing he sounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, the analysis of the physical evidence and facts requires the simultaneous application of several scientific disciplines. In this respect, failure analysis is highly interdisciplinary. Physics, chemistry, linguistics, ethnology, art history, dentistry, engineering, microscopy, materials science, biology, psychology, dactyloscopy, sociology, psychiatry, medicine, human factors engineering, anthropology, and a host of other -ologies and arcane disciplines may be brought to bear to solve a particular failure cause problem. It may astonish some to know, for example, that entomology, the study of insects, has become a useful forensic tool in determining the time of death or the location where death occurred in certain homicide cases.</p>
<p class="indent">A familiarity with codes, standards, and typical work practices is also required. This includes federal, state, and local legal codes; building codes; mechanical equipment codes; fire safety codes; electrical codes; material storage specifications; product codes and specifications; manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations; equipment installation methodologies; company procedures; and various safety rules, work rules, labor laws, regulations, and company policies. There are even guidelines promulgated by various organizations that recommend how some types of forensic investigations are to be conducted. Sometimes the various codes and standards, however, have conflicting requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">In essence, this is what an investigator does:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">He assesses the conditions that existed before the event.</li>
<li class="dotch01">He assesses the conditions that existed after the event.</li>
<li class="dotch01">He gathers and searches for verifiable evidence and facts, without bias or prejudice, that document and explain the transformation.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_6" aria-label=" Page 6. "/>He applies scientific knowledge and investigative skill to relate the various facts and evidence into a cohesive scenario of how the transformation occurred.</li>
<li class="dotch01">He reports his findings and conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Implicit in the above list of what an investigator does is the application of logic. Logic provides order and coherence to all the statements, facts, principles, and methodologies that are brought to bear on a particular case. For an investigation to be first rate, the logic that connects the pieces must be sound. Methodology, no matter whose copyrighted, franchised, colorfully diagrammed, or computerized &#x201C;root cause system&#x201D; is being used, is not a substitute for sound logic.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec1_3">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_3">The Conclusion Pyramid</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the beginning of a case, the available facts and information are like pieces of a puzzle found scattered about the floor: a piece here, a piece there, and one perhaps that has mysteriously slid under the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="indent">At first, the pieces are simply collected, gathered up, and placed in a heap on the table. Then, the pieces are sorted and each piece is fitted to all the other pieces until a few pieces match up with one another. When several pieces match up, a part of the picture begins to emerge. Eventually, when all the available pieces are fitted together, the puzzle is solved and the picture is plain to see.</p>
<p class="indent">It is for this reason that the scientific investigation and analysis of an accident, crime, catastrophic event, failure, or crime is structured like a pyramid (<a href="#fig1_1">Figure 1.1</a>). There should be a large foundation of verifiable facts and evidence at the bottom. These facts then form the basis for analysis according to proven scientific principles and methods. The facts and analysis, taken together, then support a small number of conclusions that form the apex of the pyramid.</p>
<figure id="fig1_1" class="img">
<img src="../images/fig1_1.jpg" alt=""/>

<p class="caption"><span class="imgcaption"><b>Figure 1.1</b> Investigation pyramid.</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_7" aria-label=" Page 7. "/>Conclusions should be directly based upon the facts and analysis, and not upon other conclusions, assumptions, or hypotheses. If the facts are arranged logically and systematically, the conclusions should almost be self- evident. Conclusions that are based upon other conclusions, assumptions, conjectures, or hypotheses, that in turn are based upon only a few selected facts and vague generalized principles, are a house of cards. When one point is proven wrong, the entire logical construct collapses.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the following example. It is true that propane gas systems are involved in some explosions and fires. A particular house that was equipped with a propane system sustained an explosion and subsequent fire. The epicenter of the explosion, the point of greatest explosive pressure, was located in a basement room that contained a propane furnace. From this information, the investigator concludes that the explosion and fire were caused by the propane system and, in particular, the furnace.</p>
<p class="indent">The investigator&#x2019;s conclusion, however, is based upon faulty logic. There is not sufficient information to firmly conclude that the propane system was the cause of the explosion despite the fact that the basic facts and the generalized principle upon which the conclusion is based are all true.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider again the given facts and principles in the example rearranged in the following way:</p>
<section class="secmmc03">
<p class="indent2">Principle: Some propane systems cause explosions and fires.</p>
<p class="indent2">Fact: This house had a propane system.</p>
<p class="indent2">Fact: This house sustained a fire and explosion.</p>
<p class="indent2">Fact: The explosion originated in the same room as a piece of equipment that used propane, namely, the furnace.</p>
<p class="indent2">Conclusion: The explosion and fire were caused by the propane system.</p>
</section>
<p class="indent">The principle upon which the whole conclusion depends asserts only that <i>some</i> propane systems cause explosions, <i>not all</i> of them. In fact, the majority of propane systems are reliable and work fine without causing an explosion or fire for the lifetime of the system. Arguing from a statistical standpoint, it is more likely that a given propane system will not cause an explosion and fire.</p>
<p class="indent">In our example, the investigator has not yet actually checked to see if this propane system was one of the some that work fine or one of the some that cause explosions and fires. Thus, a direct connection between the general premise and the specific case at hand has not been made. <i>A connection has only been tacitly assumed.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Further, not all explosions and fires are caused by propane systems; other things also cause fires and explosions. There is certainly a possibility that the explosion may have been caused by something not related to the propane system, which is unknown to the investigator at this point. The fact that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_8" aria-label=" Page 8. "/>explosion originated in the same room as the furnace may simply be a coincidence, a red herring.</p>
<p class="indent">Using the same generalized principle and available facts, then, it can equally be concluded by the investigator, albeit also incorrectly, that the propane system did not cause the explosion. Why is this incorrect?</p>
<p class="indent">It is incorrect because it is equally true that some propane systems never cause explosions and fires. Since this house has a propane system, then in the same manner it could be concluded that this propane system could not have been the cause of the explosion and fire.</p>
<p class="indent">As is plain, our impasse in the example is due to the application of a generalized principle for which there is insufficient information to properly deduce a unique, logical conclusion. The conclusion that the propane system caused the explosion and fire is based implicitly on the conclusion that the location of the explosion epicenter and propane furnace is no coincidence. It is further based upon another conclusion that the propane system is one of the some that cause explosions and fires, and not one of the some that never cause explosions and fires. In short, in our example we have a conclusion, based upon a conclusion, based upon another conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">The remedy to this dilemma is simple: Get more facts. Additional information must be gathered to either uniquely confirm it was the propane system or uniquely eliminate it as the cause of the explosion and fire.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the example, compressed air tests at the scene find that the propane piping found after the fire and explosion does not leak despite all that it has been through. Since propane piping that leaks before an explosion will not heal itself spontaneously so that it does not leak after an explosion, this test eliminates the propane piping as a potential cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Subsequent testing of the furnace and other appliances finds that they all work in good order also. This now puts the propane equipment in the category of the some that do not cause explosions and fires. We have now confirmed that the conclusion that assumed a cause-and-effect relationship between the location of the epicenter and the location of the propane furnace was wrong. It was simply a coincidence that the explosion occurred in the same area as the furnace.</p>
<p class="indent">Further checks by the investigator even show that there was no propane missing from the tank, which one would expect to occur had the propane been leaking for some time. Thus, now there is an accumulation of facts developing that show that the propane system was not involved in the explosion and fire.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a thorough check of the debris in the epicenter area finds that within the furnace room there were several open, 5-gallon metal containers of paint thinner, which the owner had presumed to be empty when he finished doing some painting work. Closer inspection of one of the containers finds that its sides are distended as if it had experienced a rapid expansion of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_9" aria-label=" Page 9. "/>vapors within its enclosed volume. The other paint thinner metal containers have a side that is pushed inward as if a well-distributed force had pressed upon that side of the container.</p>
<p class="indent">During follow-up questioning, the owner recalls that the various containers were placed only a few feet from a high-wattage light bulb, which was turned on just prior to the time of the explosion. A review of the safety labels finds that the containers held solvents that would form dangerous, explosive vapors at room temperature even when the containers appeared empty. The vapors evolve from a residual coating on the interior walls of the containers.</p>
<p class="indent">A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that the amount of residual solvent in just one container would be more than enough to provide a cloud of vapor that would exceed the lower threshold of the solvent&#x2019;s explosion limits. Because the actual light bulb was found damaged, a check of the surface temperature of the same make and model light bulb finds that when turned on, it quickly rises to the temperature needed to ignite paint thinner fumes. A subsequent laboratory test confirms that fumes from an erstwhile empty container set the same distance away can be ignited by the same type of light bulb and cause a flash fire.</p>
<p class="indent">The above example demonstrates the value of the <i>pyramid</i> method of investigation. When a large base of facts and information is gathered, the conclusion almost suggests itself. When only a few facts are gathered to back up a vague, generalized premise, the investigator can steer the conclusion to nearly anything he wants. Unfortunately, there are some investigators who do the latter very adroitly.</p>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_4">Some Common Terms of the Art</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following are some terms usually associated with failure investigations:</p>
<ul class="ulist">
<li><p class="numlist1"><i>Failure analysis</i>usually connotes the determination of how a specific part, component, machine, or equipment system has failed. It is usually concerned with equipment, material selection, design, product usage, methods of production, and the engineering mechanics of the failure within a component or part. However, the term is also used in connection with accidents and catastrophic events, such as building collapses or airplane crashes.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1"><i>Evidence,</i>in its legal sense, is information permitted by court rules that can be put before a jury to use in resolving disputed issues of fact. This includes witness statements, documents, objects, reports, and pertinent data related to the issue. Reports concerning scientific tests, test equipment, and analyses often involve experts. The testimony of experts, however, is not limited <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_10" aria-label=" Page 10. "/>to the scientific tests, test equipment, or analyses contained in the report, but can also include opinions and conclusions concerning the matter that are within the purview of the expert&#x2019;s special knowledge, as long as the expert is obviously better qualified to assess the facts than is the jury.</p>
<p class="indentm">There are two fundamental types of evidence: direct and circumstantial. <i>Direct evidence</i>establishes a fact that is to be proven. For example, a valid bill of sale that is not superseded by any subsequent bill of sale is direct evidence of who owns the object. Likewise, a valid birth certificate is direct evidence of a person&#x2019;s age.</p>
<p class="indentm"><i>Circumstantial evidence,</i>on the other hand, has an element of probability associated with it. The fact to be proven must be inferred by at least one logical step. For example, consider that John and Mary have been observed to live together by neighbors for many years. They raised a family and have led a typical married lifestyle. These observations might be used to infer that John and Mary were legally married. They act married; therefore, it is concluded that they are legally married.</p>
<p class="indentm">According to the <i>2005 Time Almanac</i>(p. 127), of the coupled households in the United States in 2000, 90.9% were married partners and 9.1% were unmarried partners. Thus, the conclusion that John and Mary are legally married has a 90.9% chance of being correct, if no other factors are known. Of course, this also leaves a 9.1% chance that John and Mary are not legally married, that they are just living together. This then begs the question: What is risked if the conclusion that they are legally married is made, but it turns out to be wrong?</p>
<p class="indentm">With respect to courts, with some exceptions, evidence is admitted to court proceedings if it is relevant to the matter in dispute. It must, in some way, either prove or disprove a question of fact. Direct evidence is usually admitted. Circumstantial evidence may be admitted, depending upon the judge&#x2019;s discretion, legal precedent, or special rules. The four common reasons for evidence being denied admittance to a court proceeding are:</p>
<ul class="ulist2">
<li><p class="numlist1">When the evidence is hearsay</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">When it is ruled irrelevant</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">When it is legally privileged information</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">When the evidence was obtained by illegal means</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="numlist1"><i>Root cause analysis</i>(RCA) is often used in connection with the managerial or human performance aspects of failures rather than the failure of a specific part, and how procedures and managerial techniques can be improved to prevent the problem from reoccurring. Root cause analysis is often used in association with large systems, such as power plants, construction projects, and manufacturing facilities, where there <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_11" aria-label=" Page 11. "/>is a heavy emphasis on safety and quality assurance through formalized procedures. It is generally presumed that if the true root cause is identified and then fixed, the event will not recur, at least not in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">The modifier <i>forensic</i>in <i>forensic engineering, forensic investigation, </i>and <i>forensic science</i>typically connotes that something about the investigation of the event will relate to the law, the courts, adversarial debate, or public debate and disclosure. Forensic engineering or forensic science can be either specific in scope, such as failure analysis, or general in scope, such as root cause analysis. It all depends upon the nature of the dispute.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1"><i>Contributing cause</i>denotes a factor that increases the severity of the resulting event, increases the likelihood of its occurrence, or causes the event to be advanced in time or extent. However, by itself, a contributing cause cannot cause the event to occur. An example of a contributing cause is drums of gasoline stored in an area where there is electrical sparking. While the sparking may initiate a fire, the drums of gasoline increase the chances that any resulting fire will be severe and extensive. The drums of gasoline, however, cannot start the fire.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">A<i>causative factor</i>is an action, state, or condition that existed before the event that increased the likelihood that the event would occur. There are two types of causative factors: an indirect cause and a direct cause.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">A<i>direct cause</i>is an action, state, or condition that existed immediately before the event occurred and directly allowed or promoted the occurrence of the event.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">An<i>indirect cause</i>is the same thing as a contributing cause. It sets the stage, increases the probability, or increases the severity of an event. An indirect cause, however, cannot by itself cause the event to occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">A<i>root cause</i>is a type of direct cause. It has been defined by some as the fundamental cause of the event, which when removed, modified, or corrected, would have prevented the event from occurring in the first place. Alternately, it is the fundamental cause, which when removed, modified, or corrected, will prevent the event from recurring.</p>
<p class="indentm">The preceding definition tacitly implies, however, that a failure has only one root cause. For a time, some root cause instructors did teach this tenet. They taught that all failure events could eventually be traced back to a single root cause, and that if a person had found more than one root cause, then the investigation had simply not gone deep enough. In that theory, there was to be one and only one root cause. This &#x201C;one event-one cause&#x201D; tenet had a strong philosophical appeal to some.</p>
<p class="indentm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_12" aria-label=" Page 12. "/>However, few experienced failure investigators agree that all failures, that is, all cause-and-effect relationships, have one and only one root cause. Some events do, of course, have a single root cause. However, even those who once were adherents of one event-one cause have largely abandoned the tenet.</p>
<p class="indentm">The current working definition of <i>root cause</i>is a fundamental cause that leads to the failure event either by itself or in concert with other root causes. Further, it is a cause that can be modified or affected so that another like failure can be stopped, prevented, mitigated, or caused to occur less frequently. Consequently in this pragmatic definition, a cause over which a person has no control cannot be a root cause.</p>
<p class="indentm">An example of this is lightning. Consider lightning damage to a switchyard. While it might be said that lightning caused damage to equipment in the switchyard, people do not have control over lightning as to when and where it might occur. However, people do have control of how lightning is handled in a transmission line by means of lightning protection such as arrestors, appropriate grounding, and so on. ^us, while lightning itself may cause damage, the root cause may involve a lack of appropriate equipment to safely handle the lightning.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">An<i>apparent cause</i>is typically the cause of an event as determined by a limited investigation. this often means that the evidence already at hand is considered, but a detailed, methodical investigation is not undertaken. An apparent cause investigation may include some assumptions based upon experience or probability that may not be explicitly verified. Because an apparent cause investigation is less rigorous than a root cause investigation, the risk of reaching an inaccurate conclusion is higher. However, the cost and amount of time involved with an apparent cause investigation are less. Thus, an apparent cause investigation is often undertaken when the problem is small or limited in scope, and the risk or consequences of being wrong can be tolerated.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">A<i>programmatic cause</i>is a deficiency in a procedure, program, training lesson, or other managerial construct that contains a step or instruction that increases the likelihood that a human error will occur. An example is the wording in an instruction that has several interpretations. Another example is a complex procedure that is required to be executed at a time when the worker is fatigued, in an uncomfortable environment, or under pressure to do the work quickly.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">A<i>reconstruction</i>is when a particular failure, crime, or event has been explained: how it came about, the sequence of events, the important factors, who or what was involved, what items caused which events to occur, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_13" aria-label=" Page 13. "/><i>Human performance evaluation process</i>(HPEP) is the method used to assess how people&#x2019;s actions contributed to the causation of the event. For example, if an event depended upon a person&#x2019;s actions to be successful, and instead the event was a failure:</p>
<ul class="ulist2">
<li><p class="numlist1">Did someone fail to act?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Did someone act but make the wrong choice?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Was the person fatigued, stressed, or error-prone?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist">Was the person properly trained to act correctly?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Did the person have the knowledge to make the correct decision?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Was the person distracted or otherwise prevented from acting correctly?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Did the person have a motive to promote the failure by increasing its likelihood, allow the failure to occur by inaction, or directly cause the failure?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Were there motive, means, and opportunity if the failure was deliberate?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Was the person physically capable to act properly?</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">Did the person have the correct tools or gear?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">After the fundamental cause for an event has been determined, a <i>corrective action</i>is what is done to remedy the weakness or problem identified in the root cause. The intention of the corrective action is to prevent the event from recurring due to the same reason, to mitigate the consequences if it does recur due to the same reason, or to reduce the likelihood that the event will recur due to the same reason.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1">After an investigation is done and the root cause and contributing causes have been determined, the <i>extent of condition</i>is sometimes evaluated. An extent of condition evaluation answers the following questions: Can this same type of failure or event occur elsewhere? Do the same conditions discovered in this case exist elsewhere? The idea is to use the knowledge gained from the investigation just completed to prevent similar events from occurring again elsewhere.</p>
<p class="indentm">A simple example is a faulty switch. If a failure were caused by a specific model switch that was found to have a latent manufacturing defect, other future failures could be averted if all the same model switches were found and replaced with good ones.</p></li>
<li><p class="numlist1"><i>Falsification</i>is a principle used in the application of the scientific method. The verification of a working hypothesis not only requires that the hypothesis provide some predictive value, that is, be testable, but also requires that the hypothesis not be proven incorrect. Facts and data that could prove that a hypothesis is wrong must be as vigorously pursued as facts and data that appear to prove a hypothesis correct.</p></li>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_14" aria-label=" Page 14. "/>Crime versus Failure</h2>
<p class="noindent">What is the difference between the investigation of a crime and the investigation of a failure, accident, or catastrophic event? To answer that, first let us examine the differences in their definitions.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">A <i>crime</i> is a willful action, a failure to act, or a negligence of duty that is contrary to public law or is specifically prohibited by law. Those who are found guilty of a crime are punished in accordance with penalties prescribed by law. Occasionally, they are required to make restitution.</li>
<li class="dotch01">An <i>accident</i> is an unintentional, undesirable occurrence. Often it is considered to be the result of bad fortune, ill chance, destiny, the fates, happenstance, or unfortunate coincidence. Usually, measures are taken after an accident to prevent it from recurring or to mitigate its consequences if it should occur again. An accident can also be a crime.</li>
<li class="dotch01">An <i>act of God</i> is a direct and irresistible action of nature or turn of events involving natural forces, such as storms, floods, tsunamis, lightning, droughts, and earthquakes. Typically, the term <i>act of God </i>describes a catastrophic event that cannot have been caused by a person. However, acts of God can sometimes be foreseen, avoided, or mitigated by people. This is the basis for earthquake provisions in building codes, flood control systems, and weather warning systems. Some acts of God are sometimes also considered to be accidents. The failure to provide for the mitigation of acts of God can sometimes be a crime, e.g., not providing tornado or hurricane safety shelters in mobile home parks, or not providing a neighborhood water hydrant system to put out fires caused by lightning.</li>
<li class="dotch01">A <i>catastrophe</i> is a sudden disaster or fiasco that is relatively widespread. An act of God such as a flood can be a catastrophe. An accident, such as loss of electrical power over a large region during a heat wave can be a catastrophe. A catastrophe can also be a crime, for example, the sabotage of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>A failure</i> is a nonperformance, insufficiency of performance, or performance below expectations. Failure can also be the degradation, decay, or deterioration of performance or material quality. Failures can also be accidents, catastrophes, acts of God, and sometimes crimes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The one common characteristic among all the above terms is that the resulting event is undesirable. In the initial stages of an investigation, when knowing only something about the resulting event, it is not readily apparent that the cause was due to a crime, an accident, or a failure. In fact, if the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_15" aria-label=" Page 15. "/>accident or failure was caused by the misjudgment of a person, the only difference between an accident, failure, or crime is perhaps the condition of willfulness, the motive, or whether the situation is addressed in the legal code.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, crimes, accidents, acts of God, and failures are the results of cause-and-effect phenomena. Fundamentally, they are investigated in the same way to determine how they came about.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an important distinction to note between crimes and failures that involve prosecutable liability, and other kinds of failures and accidents that may not involve prosecutable liability. The law prescribes what kind of evidence is required to convict a person of a crime or find him liable for damages. Further, the law also prescribes what kind of evidence is acceptable to the court, what weight it is to be given, and sometimes how it is to be obtained or not obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">To ensure that the facts and evidence being gathered remain court-worthy, care must be exercised to ensure that the evidence has been obtained, transported, handled, analyzed, and preserved in accordance with practices accepted by the court. Consequently, evidence to determine if a company procedure is deficient may be gathered to less stringent standards than evidence to convict a person of murder. This is to be expected. When the consequences of an investigation can result in the loss of fortune, dishonor, incarceration, or capital punishment, high standards of care are appropriate.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec1_6">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_6">How Accidents and Failures Occur</h2>
<p class="noindent">Often, an accident or failure is not the result of a single cause or event. It may be the combination of several causes or events acting in concert or in sequence. An example of causes acting in sequence might be a gas explosion.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">A spark from a pilot light ignites accumulated gas.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The gas originated from a leak in a corroded pipe.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The pipe corroded because it was poorly maintained.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The poor maintenance resulted from an inadequate maintenance budget such that other items were given higher priority.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indenteg">An example of causes acting in concert might be an automobile accident.</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">It is dusk.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Driver A has to yield to approaching traffic to make a left turn while the light is green. He doesn&#x2019;t signal his left turn, and while the light is green there is too much traffic for him to turn. At the end of the green light, he suddenly turns left, assuming there will be a gap in the traffic after the last car has passed and the light has turned yellow.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_16" aria-label=" Page 16. "/>Coming from the opposite direction, driver B enters the intersection at the tail end of the yellow light. He guns the accelerator so that he will get across the intersection while the light is still yellow.</li>
<li class="dotch01">They collide in the middle of the intersection. Car B impacts car A on the passenger side, just before car A could complete his left turn.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Driver A is drunk. His reflexes are slow and his judgment is impaired.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Driver B&#x2019;s car has bad brakes that do not operate well during hard braking. Driver B is also driving without his glasses, which he needs to see objects at a distance, especially at dusk.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Often, failures, accidents, and crimes involve both sequential events and events acting in concert in various combinations. One of the more important strategies for preventing failures is the interruption of this chain of events. Sometimes changing the outcome of just one sequential or parallel event can prevent the failure from occurring.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec1_7">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_7">Eyewitness Information</h2>
<p class="noindent">As was briefly discussed previously, eyewitness accounts are important sources of information, but they must be carefully scrutinized and evaluated. Sometimes eyewitnesses form their own opinions and conclusions about what occurred. They may then intertwine these conclusions and opinions into their account of what they say they observed. Skillful questioning of the eyewitness can sometimes separate the factual observations from the personal presumptions.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the following example. An eyewitness initially reports seeing &#x201C;Bill&#x201D; leave the building just before the fire broke out. However, careful questioning reveals that the eyewitness did not actually see Bill leave the building at all. The witness simply saw someone drive away from the building in a car similar to Bill&#x2019;s. The witness simply concluded on his own that it must have been Bill. Of course, the person driving the car could have been Bill, but it also could have been someone with a car like Bill&#x2019;s, or someone who had borrowed or stolen Bill&#x2019;s car. Bill was not actually verified by direct observation as being the driver.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, some eyewitnesses are not impartial. They may be relatives, friends, or enemies of persons involved in the event. They may have a personal stake in the outcome of the investigation.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, it is not so unusual for the arsonist who set the fire to be interviewed as an eyewitness to the fire. Arsonists sometimes hang around to watch their own handiwork being put out. Let us also not forget those eyewitnesses who are simply scalawags, psychotics, and blowhards. They may swear to anything to pursue their own agendas or get attention.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_17" aria-label=" Page 17. "/>What an honest and otherwise impartial eyewitness reports observing may also be a function of his location with respect to the event. His perceptions of the event may also be colored by his education and training, his life experiences, his physical condition with respect to eyesight or hearing, and any social or cultural biases. For example, the sound of a gas explosion might variously be reported as a sonic boom, cannon fire, blasting work, or an exploding skyrocket. Because of this, eyewitnesses to the same event may sometimes disagree on the most fundamental facts.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, the suggestibility of the eyewitness in response to questions is also an important factor. Consider the following two exchanges during <i>statementizing</i>.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec1_8">
<h2 class="exchange" id="sec1_8">Exchange I</h2>
<p class="noindent"><i>Interviewer:</i> Did you hear a gas explosion last night at about 3 a.m.?</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Witness:</i> Yeah, that&#x2019;s what I heard. I heard a gas explosion. It did occur at 3 a.m.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec1_9">
<h2 class="exchange" id="sec1_9">Exchange II</h2>
<p class="noindent"><i>Interviewer:</i> Tell me what happened last night.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Witness:</i> Something loud woke me up.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Interviewer:</i> What was it?</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Witness:</i> I don&#x2019;t know. I was asleep at the time. It was loud, though. <i>Interviewer:</i> What time did you hear it?</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Witness:</i> I don&#x2019;t know exactly. It was sometime in the middle of the night. I went right back to sleep afterwards.</p>
<p class="indenteg1"> In the first exchange, the interviewer suggested the answer to his question. Since the implied answer seems logical, and since the witness may presume that the interviewer knows more about the event than himself, the witness agrees to the suggested answer. Afterwards, the witness may repeat the information suggested to him by the interviewer as if it were his own original recollections.</p>
<p class="indent"> In the second exchange, the interviewer did not provide any clues to what he was looking for. He allowed the witness to draw upon his own memories and did not suggest any. This is preferred.</p>

<p class="noindent">The following are some of the methods commonly used in the investigation of failures, accidents, crimes, and similar events. Each will be discussed in subsequent chapters.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec1_11">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec1_11">Role in the Legal System</h2>
<p class="noindent">From time to time, a person who does this type of investigative work is called upon to testify in deposition or in court about the specifics of his or her findings. Normally the testimony consists of answers to questions posed by an attorney for an involved party. The attorney will often be interested in the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="dotch01">The investigator&#x2019;s qualifications to do this type of analysis</li>
  <li class="dotch01">The basic facts and assumptions relied upon by the investigator</li>
  <li class="dotch01">The reasonableness of the investigator&#x2019;s conclusions</li>
  <li class="dotch01">Plausible alternative explanations for the accident or failure not considered by the investigator, which often will be his client&#x2019;s version of the event.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">By virtue of appropriate education and experience, a person may be qualified as an expert witness by the court. In some states, such an expert witness is the only person allowed to render an opinion to the court during proceedings. Because the U.S. legal system is adversarial, each attorney will attempt to elicit from the expert witness testimony to either benefit his client or disparage his adversary&#x2019;s client.</p>
<p class="indent">In such a role, despite the fact that one of the attorneys may be paying the expert&#x2019;s fee, or the expert may be in the employment of one of the parties involved in the proceedings, the expert witness has an obligation to the court to be as objective as possible and to refrain from being an advocate. The best rule to follow is to be honest and professional both in preparing the original analysis and in testifying. Prior to giving testimony, however, the expert witness has an obligation to fully discuss with his or her client both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the investigator involved in preparing an accident or failure analysis is requested to review the report of analysis of the same event <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_19" aria-label=" Page 19. "/>by the expert witness for the other side. This should also be done honestly and professionally. Petty one-upmanship concerning academic qualifications, personal attacks, and unfounded criticisms is unproductive and can be embarrassing to the person who engages in it. When preparing a criticism of someone else&#x2019;s work, consider what it would sound like when read to a jury in open court.</p>
<p class="indent">Honest disagreements among qualified experts can and do occur. Sometimes the basis for the disagreement is the set of facts each has collected to use for analysis of the event. Each investigator may have a different set of facts from which to work. Sometimes the basis for disagreement is missing facts, that is, gaps in the story or the timeline, and how the investigator logically bridges those gaps. In any case, when such disagreements occur, the focus of the criticism should be the theoretical or factual basis for the differences, not <i>ad hominem</i> attacks.</p>
