<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig5_1">Figure 5.1</a>shows an x-ray radiograph of a 1N752A type Zener diode taken by Stan Silvus, manager of the Component Analysis Laboratory at Southwest Research Institute. The radiograph shows that this particular Zener diode was not manufactured with die-attach at one end of the die and had only marginal die-attach at the other end. Consequently, the die-attach deficiency caused the Zener diode to fail unexpectedly in an intermittent fashion. In turn, this caused a failure in the voltage regulator system of an emergency diesel generator system, which then caused the emergency diesel generator to be temporarily taken out of service.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent">The failure of this particular Zener diode occurred in a circuit board that had less than 40 hours of actual service time, although the circuit board itself was over 27 years old. It had been a spare board kept in inventory.</p>
<p class="indent">Going to this level of detail to gather evidence may seem extreme to some. However, this particular evidence was fundamental to validating the hypothesis that the failure event cause was a random failure due to a manufacturing defect, and falsifying the hypothesis that the failure was caused by an infant mortality type failure. In the nuclear power industry, this distinction is significant.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5_2">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec5_2">Reason 1:The Tail Wagging the Dog</h2>
<p class="noindent">As the investigation proceeds and information about the failure event accumulates, some initial cause hypotheses can be readily falsified by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_114" aria-label=" Page 114. "/>preliminary evidence and dismissed from further consideration. The smaller group of remaining hypotheses will likely share some common characteristics. Consequently, these remaining hypotheses will likely require more effort to determine which ones specifically apply.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point in the investigation it may become apparent what the final conclusion concerning the basic cause of the event might be. Based upon the evidence gathered so far, perhaps only two or three viable cause hypotheses remain in consideration. Consequently, it also becomes apparent what the corresponding corrective actions or follow-up actions might be for those causes.</p>
<p class="indent">By anticipating which corrective or follow-up actions are more palatable to the client, to management, or to the governing authorities, the investigator may begin to subconsciously, or perhaps even consciously, steer the remainder of the investigation to arrive at a conclusion whose corresponding follow- up actions are less troublesome. Evidence that appears to support a cause that leads to more palatable follow-up actions is actively sought, while evidence that might falsify the favored cause is not actively sought.</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence that might falsify the favored cause may be dismissed as being irrelevant or not needed. It may be tacitly assumed to not exist, to have disappeared, or to be too hard or expensive to find. It may even be simply ignored because so much evidence already exists to support the favored cause that the investigator presumes he already has the answer.</p>
<p class="indent">As previously noted, this is <i>a priori</i> methodology. Essentially, an outcome or conclusion is decided before the investigation has been completed. In this case, the investigator has presumed what follow-up or corrective actions are reasonable to do. Subsequently, he uses the remainder of the investigation to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_115" aria-label=" Page 115. "/>seek evidence that points to a cause that corresponds to the palatable follow- up actions he desires.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is an example of this. A close-call accident involved overturning a large, heavy, lead-lined box mounted on a relatively tall, small-wheeled cart. The failure event investigation team found that the box and wheeled cart combination was intrinsically unstable. The top-heavy cart easily tipped when the cart was moved and the front wheels had to swivel, or when the cart was rolled over a carpet edge or floor expansion joint.</p>
<p class="indent">The investigation team also found that the personnel who had moved the cart in the course of doing cleaning work in the area did so in violation of an obviously posted sign. The sign said that prior to moving the cart a supervisor was to be contacted. However, the personnel inadvertently moved the cart without contacting a supervisor in order to clean under and around the cart.</p>
<p class="indent">The easy corrective actions in this case are to chastise the personnel for not following the posted rules and to strengthen work rule adherence through training and administrative permissions. There is ample evidence to back-fit a failure event cause to support these actions. Such a cause finding, and its corresponding corrective actions, is consistent with what everyone else in the industry has done to address the problem as noted in ample operational experience reports.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, this course of action is attractive because it appeals to notions of personal accountability, is cheap to do, and can quickly dispose of the problem. In short, the close-call accident was blamed on the workers for not following the rules. The inherent instability problems found to exist in the box-and-cart combination were ignored.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, when the cart-and-box combination is rolled to a new location, the same problem may recur because the cart-and-box combination is still unstable. The new administrative permissions and additional training may reduce the probability of recurrence, but it will not eliminate it. When the cart is rolled many times to new locations, it is probable that the problem will eventually recur and perhaps cause a significant injury. It is similar to the hockey analogy of &#x201C;shots on goal.&#x201D;  Even the best goalkeeper can be scored upon if there are enough shots on goal.</p>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec5_3">Reason 2:Lipstick on a Corpse</h2>
<p class="noindent">In this instance, the failure event has been successfully investigated. An event cause has been concluded that is supported by ample evidence. Vigorous attempts to falsify the cause conclusion have failed. OK, so far, so good.</p>
<p class="indent">However, perhaps the cause conclusion involves a deficiency involving a friend of the investigator, a manager known to be vindictive and sensitive to criticism, or some company entity that cannot bear criticism due to previous <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_116" aria-label=" Page 116. "/>problems. The latter could include an individual who might get fired if he is found to have caused the problem, an organization that might be fined or sued for violating a regulation or law, or a department that might be reorganized or eliminated for repeatedly causing problems.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, the investigator is aware that the actual consequences of identifying and documenting the cause of the event will be greater than just the corrective actions themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">When faced with this dilemma, some investigators attempt to wordsmith the failure event cause report in an effort to minimize perceived negative findings and emphasize perceived positive findings. Instead of using plain, factually descriptive language to describe what occurred, less precise and more positive-sounding language is used.</p>
<p class="indent">Wordsmithed reports are relatively easy to spot. Instead of using plain modifiers such as <i>deficient</i> or <i>inadequate</i> to describe a process, phrases such as &#x201C;less than sufficient&#x201D;  or &#x201C;less than adequate&#x201D;  are used. Instead of reporting that a component has failed a surveillance test, the component is reported to have had &#x201C;less than the target output&#x201D;  or perhaps &#x201C;met 95% of its expected goals.&#x201D; </p>
<p class="indent">In such cases, the event cause report becomes a quasi-public relations document that sometimes has conflicting purposes. Because it is an event cause report, its primary purpose is supposed to be a no-nonsense, fact-based report that documents what went wrong and indicates how to fix it. However, a secondary purpose is introduced, which is to convince the reader that the failure event and its underlying cause are not nearly as bad as the reader might otherwise think.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to recurrence, there are two fundamental problems with wordsmithing a failure event cause report. The first is that it blurs or mitigates the effectiveness of the corrective or follow-up actions. Corrective actions work best when they are specific and targeted. A diluted or minimized cause, however, is often matched to a diluted or minimized corrective action.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a strong analogy to the practice of medicine in this instance. When a person has an infection, if the degree of infection is underestimated, the medicine dose may be insufficient and the infection will recur. This is also true for failure event investigations.</p>
<p class="indent">The second problem is that by putting a good &#x201C;spin&#x201D;  on the problem, management or the authorities may not properly support what needs to be done to fix the problem. In other words, the report succeeds in convincing its audience that the failure event is not a serious problem that warrants serious attention.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5_4">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec5_4">Reason 3:Elementary, My Dear Watson, Elementary</h2>
<p class="noindent">In some ways, failure event investigations are a lot like whodunit novels. Some plant or office personnel just cannot resist making a guess about what caused <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_117" aria-label=" Page 117. "/>the failure in the same way that mystery buffs often try to second-guess who will be revealed to be the murderer at the end of the story. It certainly is fun for a person, and perhaps even a point of pride, if his initial guess turns out to be right. However, there are circumstances when such a guess can jeopardize the integrity of a failure event investigation.</p>
<p class="indent">The circumstances are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotc05">The guess is made by a senior manager involved in the investigation process.</li>
<li class="dotc05">The plant or facility has an authoritarian, chain-of-command style organization.</li>
<li class="dotc05">The management culture puts a high premium on being right and has a zero-defects attitude about being wrong.</li>
<li><p class="numlist5">The scenario goes something like this:</p></li>
<li class="dotc05">A failure event occurs or a condition adverse to quality is discovered.</li>
<li class="dotc05">Some preliminary data are quickly gathered about conditions in the plant when the failure occurred.</li>
<li class="dotc05">From this preliminary data, a senior manager guesses that the fundamental cause will likely be x, because
<ol class="ol">
<li class="orderedlist05">he was once at a plant where the same thing occurred or has read about it in an article; or</li>
<li class="orderedlist05">applying his own engineering acumen, he deduces the nature of the failure from the preliminary data like a Sherlock Holmes or a Miss Marple.</li>
</ol></li>
<li class="dotc05">Not being particularly eager to prove their senior manager wrong and deal with the consequences, the investigation team looks for information that supports his hypothesis.</li>
<li class="dotc05">Not surprisingly, they find some; the presumption is then made that the cause has been found and fieldwork ceases.</li>
<li class="dotc05">A report is prepared, submitted, and approved, possibly by the same senior manager who made the Sherlockian guess.</li>
<li class="dotc05">The senior manager takes a bow, once again proving why he is a senior manager.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The deficiency in this scenario that can lead to failure event recurrence is the fact that falsification of the favored hypothesis was not pursued. Once a cause was presumed to have been found, significant evidence gathering ceased. (Why waste resources when we already have the answer?) Consequently, evidence that may have falsified the hypothesis, or perhaps supported an alternate hypothesis, was left in the field.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_118" aria-label=" Page 118. "/>Again, this is another example of an <i>a priori</i> methodology: where the <i>de facto</i> purpose of the investigation is to gather information that supports the favored hypothesis. In short, the fundamental cause of the event was missed, a seemingly plausible one was accepted, and the fundamental problem that caused the event in the first place was not fixed or addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">In this regard, there was a famous experiment conducted by Daniel Simmons of the University of Illinois and Christopher Chabris of Harvard University about directed observation that applies. Test subjects in the experiment were told to watch a type of basketball game carefully because they would be questioned about how many times the basketballs would be tipped into the air by the participants.</p>
<p class="indent">Two teams of three players on each tossed around two basketballs for 1 minute in a video. One team was dressed in white shirts, the other in black shirts. Test subjects were asked to count the number of passes made by the white team during the &#x201C;game.&#x201D; After 35 seconds, a person in a gorilla suit walked into the room, beat his chest, and 9 seconds later, exited. Incredibly, only 50% of the viewers tasked with counting passes noticed the gorilla. They were focused on counting passes.</p>
<p class="indent">When the test subjects who did not see the gorilla were told about it, they were incredulous and did not believe that they had missed seeing someone masquerading as a gorilla&#x2014;  until they were shown the tape a second time. At that point, they all observed the gorilla. This effect, of not seeing the obvious because of being focused on a specific task or activity, is sometimes called inattentional blindness.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5_5">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec5_5">Reason 4: Dilution of the Solution</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following situation is usually peculiar to large organizations with many administrative processes that have individual departments whose departmental priorities are not in alignment with company priorities.</p>
<p class="indent">The investigation of a failure condition has been completed and was well done. The root cause of the condition and all contributing causes were properly identified. An excellent corrective action plan was crafted to fix the problem. The plan was presented to senior management. Senior management approved the plan, wholly supported the plan, and provided adequate resources to execute the plan. The problem is fixed, right?</p>
<p class="indent">Not so fast. Let&#x2019; s say that the original failure condition involved a deficient quality control process in the company&#x2019; s safety program. Specifically, too many injuries and accidents had occurred in the plant in the past 2 years. Consequently, insurance costs had increased, the number of lost workdays had increased, and regulatory scrutiny was being threatened due to the resulting high OSHA reportables rate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_119" aria-label=" Page 119. "/>Most quality control processes involve four parts. For a safety program, the four parts are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotc05">Establishment of specific safety standards that are to be followed</li>
<li class="dotc05">Communication of those standards to the people who have to follow them</li>
<li class="dotc05">Reinforcement of those standards by reminders, mentoring, training, and supervisory oversight</li>
<li class="dotc05">Enforcement of those standards</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In the investigation, it was found that only the enforcement part was being done, and even that was not being done consistently. Different divisions of the company had different safety practices. No training of employees and supervisors about company safety rules had been done in years despite an influx of new, inexperienced employees. Supervisors and managers did not remind employees prior to a job being undertaken what safety rules needed to be observed and what safety gear had to be worn. When some supervisors noted that safety gear was not being utilized, because they were unsure of what company policy was, they often did not say anything to the employee</p>
<p class="indent">The investigation noted that unless all four parts of the process were done effectively and in order, low accident and injury rates could not be achieved. In reviewing both successful and unsuccessful safety programs at similar plants, when all four parts were executed well and in an orderly fashion, injury and accident rates were low. In plants where one, two, or more of the parts were executed poorly or not even performed, accident and injury rates were higher.</p>
<p class="indent">In investigating the situation, the root cause investigation team had used a modified form of the barrier method to figure out what was wrong and what should be done. First, a model program that worked well was flowcharted. Then, the actual program used at the company was flowcharted the same way so that it could be compared to the model program, item by item. Where there was a difference between the model and the company&#x2019; s program, a corrective action was proposed to fix the discrepancy.</p> 
<p class="indent">However, when it came time to actually execute the various corrective actions, the plan fell apart. The manager tasked with developing a consistent, company-wide set of safety standards and practices had other, higher- priority tasks to do and had vacation already scheduled. Consequently, he had the scheduled due date extended to fit his personal and departmental schedule. The extension was easily approved since that manager had considerable administrative clout, and the approving authority was unaware of the importance of this task being done on time with respect to the overall corrective action plan.</p>
<p class="indent">With no consistent safety standard and practices in place, the people responsible for training employees did not know what training to provide.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_120" aria-label=" Page 120. "/>However, because they did not want to miss their scheduled deadline, they trained personnel in accordance with the patchwork of safety standards that already existed. This further institutionalized the existing confusion about safety practices.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the training for supervisors did not include the new material about how to reinforce safety practices by performing prejob briefs and supervisory coaching techniques, there seemed to be no difference in the new company safety policy from the old one. Consequently, the reinforcement part of the plan lapsed.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, because the training was confusing and inconsistent, supervisors were not sure what practices they should enforce. Thus, enforcement of existing safety practices continued more or less as it had been done before.</p>
<p class="indent">The end result is that the well-considered corrective action plan did not readily fix the problem as intended. While no one was apparently looking, a company goal, the establishment of a consistent company safety program in accordance with good quality control process practices to lower accident and injury rates, was subverted to oblige a departmental scheduling convenience.</p>
<p class="indent">This above example brings to mind a quotation attributed to Benjamin Franklin:</p>
<section class="secmmc03">
<p class="indent">For want of a nail the shoe was lost.</p>
<p class="indent">For want of a shoe the horse was lost.</p>
<p class="indent">For want of a horse the rider was lost.</p>
<p class="indent">For want of a rider the battle was lost.</p>
<p class="indent">For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.</p>
<p class="indent">And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.</p>
</section>
<p class="indent">In the preceding example, the fundamental problem was that the corrective action plan suffered from exactly the same fundamental problem that had been identified by the root cause investigation. The same managers and departments were put in charge of fixing the problem that had created in the first place, they approached the work with the same attitude concerning its importance, and they ended up with the same result.</p>
<p class="indent">To successfully circumvent this pitfall, the corrective action plan schedule should have been delegated to an authority one level above the departments involved in the execution of its various parts. This person should have had the authority to muster resources and establish priorities to ensure that the parts of the plan were completed on time and coordinated properly, in the manner of a project manager.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, a plant-level goal should be managed by a plant-level manager. Putting departmental managers in charge of a plant-level goal subverts the plant-level goal into a departmental project.</p>
