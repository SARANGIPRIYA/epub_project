<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec6_1">Reporting the Findings of an Investigation</h2>
<p class="indent">There are several formats used to report the results of an investigation. The easiest format is a simple narrative, where the investigator simply describes all his investigative endeavors in chronological order. He starts from when he received the telephone call from the client and continues until the last item in the investigation has been completed. The report can be composed daily or piece-wise when something important occurs as the investigation progresses, like a diary or journal. Insurance adjusters, fire investigators, and detectives often keep such a chronological journal to record their findings. A narrative report is simply a more readable, edited version of such a journal or diary.</p>
<p class="indent">A narrative report works well when the investigation involves only a few matters and the evidence is straightforward. However, it can be difficult for a reader to imagine the event reconstruction from a simple narrative report when there are many facts to consider, when the line of reasoning is involved, when there are test results and laboratory reports that require evaluation, when there are eyewitness accounts that have to be cross-correlated to each other and to the laboratory reports, and when several interconnected scientific principles have to be understood and applied. The links and significance among these various items, which may be discovered at various times during the investigation, may not be readily apparent to the reader in a simple narrative. The investigation process itself may not proceed in a logical, step-by- step fashion. Also, sometimes answers show up before the questions are even fully developed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alternately, an investigative report can be prepared like an academic paper, replete with technical jargon, equations, graphs, and copious reference <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_122" aria-label=" Page 122. "/>footnotes. This type of report, while appropriate for reporting research or the findings of a particular investigation to similarly experienced professionals, is often unsatisfactory. It may not readily convey the findings and assessments of the investigation to the variety of people who need to ultimately read, understand, and use the report.</p>
<p class="indent">To determine what kind of format to use, it is often best to first consider who will be reading the report. In general, the audience who might read a root cause investigation report includes the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01"><i>Claims Adjusters:</i> The adjuster will use the report to determine whether a claim should be paid under the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. If he suspects there is subrogation potential, he will forward the report to the company&#x2019; s attorney for evaluation. In some insurance companies, such reports are automatically evaluated for subrogation potential. Subrogation is a type of lawsuit filed by an insurance company to get back the money they paid out on a claim by suing a third party that might have had something to do with causing the loss.
<p class="indentch02">For example, if a windstorm blows the roof off of a house, the insurance company will pay the claim to the homeowner, but may then sue the original contractor because the roof was supposed to withstand such storms without being damaged.</p>
</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Law Enforcement Authorities:</i> They will certainly be interested if the report is related to a crime, criminal negligence, or a violation of the law. If that is the case, the report may form the basis for further investigation and may become part of their body of evidence if prosecution is pursued. They may compare the facts and findings in the report against what they may have already collected, and may repeat or otherwise verify any laboratory work to confirm findings and observations discussed in the report. If any evidence was collected and stored during the preparation of the report, law enforcement authorities may take possession of it.
<p class="indentch02">If there is apparent evidence or information in the report that indicates that there has been a crime, in most cases there is a professional and legal obligation to bring this to the attention of the proper authorities. The only exception that might apply to this obligation is when the principle of client-attorney privilege has been invoked. If this is the case, carefully clarify what your obligations are with the attorney of record in this matter.</p>
</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Attorneys:</i> This includes attorneys for both the plaintiff and the defendant. The attorneys will scrutinize every line and every word used in the report. Often, they will inculcate meaning into a word or phrase that the investigator never intended. Sometimes the investigator will <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_123" aria-label=" Page 123. "/>inadvertently use a word in an engineering context that also has a specific meaning in a legal context. The legal meaning may be different from the engineering meaning. Lawyers are by trade wordsmiths. Engineers as a group are renowned for being poor writers. This disparity in language skill often provides the attorneys for either side with plenty of sport in reinterpreting the engineer&#x2019; s report to mean what they need it to mean. </li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Technical Experts:</i> The report will also be read by various technical experts who possess similar skills and knowledge as the members of the investigating team. They may be only professionally interested, or they may be auditing the report searching for technical errors or omissions. They will want to know upon what facts and observations the investigator relied, which regulations and standards he consulted and applied, and what scientific principles or methodologies were used to reach the conclusions about the cause of the loss or failure. The experts for the other side, of course, will challenge each and every facet of the report that is detrimental to their client and will attempt to prove that the report is a worthless sham. Whatever standard the investigator used in his report will, of course, be shown to be incorrect, incorrectly applied, or not as good as the one used by the other side&#x2019; s technical expert.
<p class="indentch02">One common technique that is used to discredit a report is to segment the report into minute component parts, none of which, when examined individually, are detrimental to their side. This technique is designed to disconnect the interrelationships of the various components and destroy the overall meaning and context. It is akin to examining individual liver cells, or perhaps the spleen in a person&#x2019; s body, to determine if the person is in love or roots for the Cardinals.</p>
</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>The Author:</i> Several years after the report has been turned in to the client and the matter has been completely forgotten about, the investigator who originally authored the report may have to deal with it again. Court cases can routinely take several years for anything to happen. Thus, several years after the original investigation, the investigator may be called upon to testify in deposition or court about his findings, methodologies, and analytical processes. Since so much has happened in the meantime, he may have to rely upon his own report to remind himself of the particulars of the case and what he did.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Judge and Jury:</i> If the matter does end up in trial, the judge will decide if the report can be admitted into evidence, which means that the jury will be allowed to read it. Because this is done in a closed jury room, the report must be understandable and convey the author&#x2019; s reasoning and conclusions solely within the four corners of each <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_124" aria-label=" Page 124. "/>page. It is well to bear in mind that the average jury has an educational level of less than 12th grade. Most jurors are uncomfortable with equations and statistical data. Some jurors may believe &#x201C;there is something to&#x201D; astrology and alien visitations, will be distrustful of &#x201C;pointy-headed professors&#x201D; from out of town, and since high school, their main source of new scientific knowledge has consisted of television shows and popular publications such as <i>The National Enquirer.</i></li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Managers:</i> If the matter involved a process, machine, or event that occurred in a business setting, the people who manage the company will want to understand what is in the report and use the report as a basis for corrective action to prevent or mitigate something similar from occurring again. In some cases, a person might be fired based upon the findings of such a report; in other cases, it might form the basis for a significant investment in equipment or training.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Other Professionals:</i> Professionals in related industries may wish to avoid having this type of event occur at their plant or facility, or perhaps it has already occurred and they wish to see if what they experienced has factors in common with what is described in the report.
<p class="indentch02">In order to satisfy these various audiences, the following report format, or a variant of it, is often used that is consistent with the pyramid method of investigation noted previously. This format is based on the classical style of argument used in the Roman Senate almost 2,000 ago to present bills. As it did then, the format successfully conveys information about the matter to a varied audience, who can chose the elevation of detail they wish to obtain from the report by reading the appropriate sections.</p></li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Report Identifiers:</i> This includes the title and date of the report, the names and addresses of the author and client, and any identifying information, such as case number, file number, and date of loss. The identifying information can be easily incorporated into the inside address section if the report is written as a business letter. Alternately, the identifying information is sometimes listed on a separate page preceding the main body of the report. This allows the report to be separate from other correspondence. A cover letter is then usually attached.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Purpose:</i> This is a succinct statement of what the investigator seeks to accomplish. It is usually a single statement or a very short paragraph. For example, &#x201C;To determine the nature and cause of the fire that damaged the Smith home, 1313 Bluebird Lane, on January 22, 1999.&#x201D; From this point on, all parts of the report should directly relate to this &#x201C;mission statement.&#x201D; If any sentence, paragraph, or section of the report does not advance the report toward satisfying the stated <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_125" aria-label=" Page 125. "/>purpose, that part should be edited out. The conclusions at the end of the report should explicitly answer the question implied by the purpose statement, e.g., &#x201C;The fire at the Smith house was caused by an electrical short in the kitchen ventilation fan.&#x201D;</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Background Information:</i> This part of the report sets the stage for the rest of the report. It contains general information as to what happened so that the reader understands what is being discussed. A thumbnail outline of the basic events and the various parties involved in the matter is included. It may also contain a brief chronological outline of the work done by the investigator. It differs from an abstract or summary in that it contains no analysis, conclusions, or anything persuasive.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Findings and Observations:</i> This is a list of all the factual findings and observations made related to the investigation. No opinions or analysis is included: &#x201C;just the facts, ma&#x2019; am.&#x201D; However, the arrangement of the facts is important. A useful technique is to list the more general observations and findings first, and the more detailed items later on. As a rule, going from the &#x201C;big picture&#x201D; to the details is easier for the reader to follow than randomly jumping from minute detail to a big picture item and then back to a detail item again. It is sometimes useful to organize the data into related sections, again, listing generalized data first, and then more detailed items later. Movie directors often use the same technique to quickly convey detailed information to the viewer. An overview scene of where the action takes place is first shown, and then the camera begins to move closer to where things are happening</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Analysis:</i> This is the section wherein the investigator gets to explain how the various facts relate to one another. The facts are analyzed and their significance is explained to the reader. Highly technical calculations or extensive data are normally listed in an appendix, but the salient points are summarized and explained here for the reader&#x2019; s consideration.</li>
<li class="dotch01"> <i>Conclusions:</i> In just a few sentences, perhaps even just one, the findings are summarized and the conclusion stated. The conclusion should be stated clearly, with no equivocation, using the indicative mode. For example, a conclusion stated as &#x201C;&#x2026;   the fire could have been caused by the hot water tank&#x201D; is a guess. It implies that it also could have been caused by something other than the hot water tank. Anyone can make a guess. Professional investigators make conclusions.
<p class="indentch02">As noted previously, the conclusions should answer the question posed in the &#x201C;Purpose&#x201D; section of the report. If the report has been written cohesively up to this point, the conclusion should be already obvious to the reader because it should rest securely on the pyramid of facts, observations, and analysis already firmly established.</p></li>
<li class="dotch01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_126" aria-label=" Page 126. "/><i>Remarks:</i> This is a cleanup, administrative section, which sometimes is required to take care of case details, e.g., &#x201C;the evidence has been moved and is now being stored at the Acme garage&#x201D; or &#x201C;it is advisable to put guards on that machine before any more poodles are sucked in.&#x201D; Sometimes during the course of the investigation, insight is developed into related matters that may affect safety and general welfare. In the nuclear industry, the expression used to describe this is &#x201C;extent of condition.&#x201D; Most states require a licensed engineer or professional to promptly warn the appropriate officials and persons of conditions adverse to safety and general welfare to prevent loss of life, loss of property, or environmental damage. This is usually required even if the discovery is detrimental to his own client.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Appendix:</i> If there are detailed calculations or extensive data relevant to the report, they go here. The results of the calculations or analysis of data are described and summarized in the &#x201C;Analysis&#x201D; section of the report. By putting the calculations and data here, the general reading flow of the report is not disrupted for those readers who cannot follow the detailed calculations or are simply not interested in them. And for those who wish to plunge into the details, they are readily available for examination.</li>
<li class="dotch01"><i>Attachments:</i> This is the place to put photographs and photograph descriptions, excerpts of regulations and codes, lab reports, and other related items that are too big or inconvenient to directly insert into the body of the report, but are nonetheless relevant. Often, in the &#x201C;Findings and Observations&#x201D; portion of the report, reference is made to &#x201C;Photograph 1&#x201D; or &#x201C;Diagram 2B, which is included in the attachments&#x201D; due to space limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In many states, a report detailing the findings and conclusions of an engineering investigation is required to be signed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer because by state law engineering investigations are the sole prerogative of licensed, professional engineers.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, on the last page of the main body of the report, usually just after the &#x201C;Conclusions&#x201D; section, the report is often signed and dated, and the report is sealed by the responsible licensed professional engineer, or engineers, who performed the investigation. Often, the other technical professionals who worked under the direction of the responsible professional engineer are also listed, if they have not been noted previously in the report, or do not have their own section in the report.</p>
<p class="indent">Some consulting companies purport to provide investigative technical services, investigative consulting services, or scientific consulting services. Their reports may be signed by persons with various initials or titles after their names. These designations have varying degrees of legal status or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_127" aria-label=" Page 127. "/>legitimacy vis-&#x00E0;-vis engineering investigations, depending upon the particular state or jurisdiction. Thus, it is important to know the professional status of the person who signs the report. An engineering report signed by a person without the requisite professional or legally required credentials in the particular jurisdiction may lack credibility and perhaps even legal legitimacy.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases when the report is long and complex, an executive summary as well as perhaps a table of contents may be added to the front of the report. The executive summary, which is generally a few paragraphs and no more than a page, notes the highlights of the investigation, including the conclusions. A table of contents indicates the organization of the report and allows the reader to rapidly find sections and items he wishes to review, and warns him away from the materials he does not want to review.</p>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec6_2">Three Sample Reports</h2>
<p class="noindent">Three sample reports are provided following this section. The first is about the investigation of a trash fire that occurred in the machine shop of a nuclear power plant. The consequence of the fire was that a notification of unusual event (NOUE) was declared at the plant. The second is about the investigation of an explosion in a small, coal-fired power plant during start-up. The explosion caused considerable damage to the plant and significantly delayed the plant from going back online. The third is about a specific component failure, a bearing failure, within a multistage, high-pressure centrifugal pump. Since the pump system had sufficient redundancy to continue operations without a problem, the failure of the pump did not cause any significant consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">To fit the client&#x2019; s particular needs, the first report was organized as follows:</p>

</section>
<p class="indent">The specific order of the first sample report varies from the Roman Senate model outlined in the previous section. However, it contains all the elements of that model and accomplishes the primary goal of that format&#x2014;  of providing information to satisfy the requirements of several types of readers.</p>
<p class="indent">The first sample report, which is about the investigation of a trash fire in a mechanical repair shop of a nuclear power plant, has been edited from the original version to save space. However, it still contains all the salient features related to reporting the results of a failure investigation.</p>
<p class="indent">The unedited version, which runs about fifty typewritten pages, includes verbatim interviews; cause codes used to administratively track failure types in a computer database; verbatim product warning and information notices; items relating to administrative and regulatory reporting obligations associated with the event; a section on cost estimates associated with fixing the problem; a specific detailed list of corrective actions, which departments in the company will do them, and the schedule when they will be done; and other industry-specific and plant-specific information. The inclusion of all this other material, some of which only indirectly relates to the event being investigated, is typical of nuclear industry reports, which often try to include all related issues within a single report.</p>
<p class="indent">The second report, which has been edited to remove identifiers, follows more closely the Roman Senate format described in the first section of this chapter. It is organized as follows:</p>
<section  class="secmmc03">
<p class="major1">Cover page: Title, identifiers, and one-paragraph abstract.</p>
<p class="major1">Purpose: The question the investigation should answer.</p>

</section>
<p class="indent">The differences between the first two case study reports demonstrate well some of the fundamental differences between organizations as to what is expected from an investigation report.</p>
<p class="indent">The first report, especially the full, unedited version not shown here, is detailed and inclusive. It not only addresses the technical matters related to the cause of the event itself, but also includes postevent administrative matters, such as what corrective actions, both technical and administrative, are to be done to fix the deficient conditions that were found, which departments will do them, what the completion schedule will be, what it might cost, what regulatory reporting obligations are be associated with this event that have to be addressed, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">In essence, besides determining the cause of the event, the investigation team also provides company decision-making guidance that would usually result from a technical or managerial policy feasibility study. Consequently, the investigation mandate of the first report can be broadly divided into two parts: what, how, and why the event happened; and what and how the company should correct the conditions that led to the failure to ensure that the event will not recur.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the first case study report serves not only several audiences, but also several purposes. Not surprisingly, this type of report takes more time, requires more resources, and should, but not always does, have senior policy makers actively participating in the investigation team. Implicit in this type of report is the presumption that the investigating team is not only expert in the investigation side of the assignment, but also expert in developing, planning, and implementing the fixes.</p> 
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_130" aria-label=" Page 130. "/>The second case study report focuses more on the failure event itself and explains what, how, and why it occurred. The second case study report fundamentally serves only one purpose. Once the problem areas that lead to the event have been clearly identified, the report is complete. Since there are many combinations of ways in which the deficiencies can be fixed that involve company policy, budget obligations, and internal administrative matters, the investigation team leaves those matters to another team or process.</p>
<p class="indent">Implicit in this type of report is the presumption that the investigation team is expert about the investigation side of the assignment and has the mandate to carry out this function. However, the team may not have the expertise or the mandate to develop, plan, and implement any specific fixes. This may be an involved process subject to several administrative elevations of approvals.</p>
<p class="indent">The third case study report example is a type that is typically used to investigate and document a specific, narrowly focused problem, usually the unexpected failure of a single component, item, or process. Sometimes these reports are called white papers. The scope of a white paper investigation is narrow because, usually, the consequences of the failure are narrow and less significant.</p>
<p class="indent">The report usually has an audience of perhaps just a few people, and the audience is often as knowledgeable, or nearly so, as the expert who has been tasked with the investigation and subsequent preparation of the report. The report may only be circulated within a single department, or perhaps among a small number of departments.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, the language in the report can be more technical and can dispense with background explanations of information and principles commonly understood by both the preparer and the audience. Not surprisingly, this type of report is less formal and has a more abbreviated format.</p> 
<p class="indent">It is not unusual, however, to find that the evidence, findings, and conclusions in white papers may later on be incorporated into other, more formal reports. For example, the bearing misalignment concluded to have occurred in the third case study might be symptomatic of an overall knowledge and skill deficiency that has led to several such bearing failures, necessitating a programmatic remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">The third case study example included in this chapter is organized as follows:</p>
<section class="secmmc03">
<p class="major1">Title page: Includes identifiers and brief statement of purpose.</p>
<p class="major1">Brief Background Information: Just enough information so that the reader knows something about the circumstance of the failure.</p>
<p class="major1">Observations: A recounting of the pertinent verifiable facts upon which the report&#x2019; s conclusion is based.</p>
<p class="major1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_131" aria-label=" Page 131. "/>Analysis: The engineering analysis that applies engineering methods and principles to the facts to assess what has happened.</p>
<p class="major1">Conclusions: One short paragraph that indicates why the bearing failed, and another short paragraph that recommends how to avoid similar failures.</p>

<p class="noindent">This report describes a trash fire that occurred at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Brownville, Nebraska, on March 14, 2005. A 1,000-watt high-intensity discharge mercury vapor lamp located in the ceiling of a shop area caused the fire. Due to both the intrinsic properties of the lamp and the way in which the lamp had been operated, the discharge tube within the lamp ruptured and hot quartz particles dropped into a trash bin. The hot particles then ignited flammable trash inside the bin by contact.</p>
<p class="subheading06">PURPOSE</p>
<p class="noindent">To determine the cause of the fire that occurred in the CNS multipurpose facility on March 14, 2005, and to prevent or mitigate the risk of a similar fire recurring.</p>
<p class="subheading06">EVENT SCENARIO</p>
<p class="noindent">Sensors detected the fire at 2:47 a.m. on March 14, 2005. The fire was then visually confirmed by operators to be in a plastic trash bin in the multipurpose facility, the inside shop area, at Cooper Nuclear Station and was quickly extinguished. The circumstances that led to the fire are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">Lamping in the multipurpose facility is primarily accomplished with high- intensity discharge (HID) mercury vapor lamps. On Friday, March 11, 2005, an HID mercury vapor lamp located directly above the plastic trash bin was anecdotally reported to have been flickering.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The trash bin was empty at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, March 11, 2005. After 2:30 p.m. and during the weekend of March 12&#x2013;13, 2005, cardboard, wood, plastic, and other trash items were placed in the bin.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Due to an end-of-life phenomenon called de-vitrification, the HID lamp that had been reportedly flickering sustained an arc tube rupture. Hot pieces of quartz, some perhaps as hot as 1,832&#x00B0;F, dropped from the lamp fixture into the bin. The bin was about 45 feet directly below the lamp.</li>
<li class="dotch01">During the approximate 2 seconds of fall from the fixture to the bin, the hot debris remained sufficiently hot to ignite paper and plastic materials.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The ensuing fire melted the plastic sides and bottom of the bin. Burning materials fell out of the bin and onto the floor next to a metal modular shipping container that was adjacent to the bin. These burning materials heated and burned the exterior painted metal wall of the metal shipping container.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Heat conducted through the metal wall of the metal shipping container and damaged the interior paint, and perhaps some plastic materials leaning against the interior wall. Initially this was a smoulder. When the doors of the container were opened to investigate the smoke, fresh air was admitted and the smoulder ignited.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="subheading06">ROOT CAUSE AND CAUSAL FACTORS</h2>
<p class="noindent">The <i>root cause</i> of this fire was the inappropriate use of open-fixture, non-O-type HID lamps over an area that regularly contains a fire load.</p>
<p class="indent">The arc tube in HID lamps can unexpectedly rupture when they are run to failure without being periodically turned on and off. Examination of the fire scene confirmed that arc tube rupture of the lamp above the trash bin occurred.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_134" aria-label=" Page .134 "/>Warnings and advisories on the replacement lamp packaging indicate that either this type of lamping should have a cover over the fixture, to prevent hot, rupture debris from falling out, or a type O lamp and ballast should be used. A type O lamp and ballast is designed to contain arc tube rupture debris.</p>
<p class="indent">There were two <i>contributing causes</i> for the fire. The first was housekeeping. When the arc tube ruptured, the hot arc tube debris could have either fallen harmlessly onto a noncombustible surface, such as a bare concrete floor, or landed on combustible materials. Due to housekeeping practices, it landed on combustible materials.</p>
<p class="indent">The second <i>contributing cause</i> was an administrative deficiency concerning keeping up with safety standards that change over time. Safety warnings and advisories concerning HID mercury vapor lamps were published by OSHA as early as 1986. The lamp manufacturer and the National Electric Manufacturers&#x2019;  Association have published additional advisories since then. The newly published 2005 National Electric Code specifically addresses the issue of HID lamps. Warnings about arc tube rupture and the consequential fire hazard are directly printed on the packaging of HID replacement lamp bulbs. Despite this information, the hazard was not recognized. This noncognizance is attributed to the fact that when the building was designed and built, lamping did meet the safety standards in effect at the time. The building&#x2019; s lamping system had not been reassessed since then.</p>
<p class="subheading06">RISK AND EXTENT OF CONDITION</p>
<p class="noindent">The arc tubes in non-O-type mercury vapor HID lamps can unexpectedly rupture when they are run to failure and are not periodically cycled on and off. In open fixtures, an arc tube rupture creates falling hot quartz debris. If it falls on combustibles, a fire can ensue. If it falls on persons, it can injure them. If it falls into equipment or into items open to the air, such as tanks containing liquids, it can cause damage, fire, or contamination.</p>
<p class="indent">A survey of Cooper Nuclear Station found that there were perhaps several hundred 1,000-watt and 400-watt HID mercury and metal halide lamps in use. None of the HID lamps were being cycled in accordance with the manufacturer&#x2019; s recommendations to minimize arc tube rupture risk. No one in facilities or maintenance was familiar with those recommendations.</p>
<p class="subheading06">IMMEDIATE AND INTERIM COMPENSATORY ACTIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">On March 16, 2005, two days after the fire occurred, the root cause team leader and the electrical superintendent met and discussed actions to ameliorate shortterm risk. The actions included reduction of fire load in the area through better housekeeping and immediate replacement of 1,000-watt lamps that are dim, burnt out, or flickering. Operators were instructed to periodically turn off and on HID lamps in accordance with the manufacturer&#x2019; s recommended schedule, and a complete re-lamping of HID lamps was planned.</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of re-lamping the multipurpose facility, it was discovered that some of the lamps did not have the correct matching ballast. Further, it was discovered that one of the non-HID mercury vapor lamp fixtures had been damaged by excessive heating by the lamp: its plastic cover was charred and had partially melted. When the HID mercury vapor lamps were initially turned off and on, i.e., cycled, two failures occurred. One was in a lamp that had been noted to be dim. It failed to come back on as expected but the arc tube did not rupture. In a second <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_135" aria-label=" Page 135. "/>lamp that was not noted to be dim but had anecdotally been noted to occasionally flicker, this lamp sustained an arc tube rupture.</p>
<p class="subheading06">LONGER-TERM CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS</p>
<p class="noindent">The following is a summary of the corrective actions that were taken:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">All high-bay, HID lamping in the plant that could suffer arc tube rupture was surveyed and evaluated for risk.</li>
<li class="dotch01">A scheduled preventive maintenance task list was developed and executed to replace the interim actions.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Site housekeeping awareness was improved.</li>
<li class="dotch01">A study was initiated to determine what should be done with existing HID lamping at the plant to bring it into compliance with the 2005 NEC, as well as OSHA and good IEEE lamping standards.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subheading2ch06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_136" aria-label=" Page 136. "/>Appendix A: Fire Scene Investigation</p>
<p class="noindent">The root cause team leader and the plant fire marshal conducted a fire scene investigation in the multipurpose facility on March 14, 2005, beginning about 8:30 a. m. The following findings and observations were made:</p>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="orderedlist06">The fire originated inside a gray-colored plastic bin located on the west side of a CVAN, a metal truck shipping container. The CVAN had been set next to a bay door in the middle of the multipurpose facility. The CVAN exhibited fire damage on the exterior side of a metal wall proximate to the plastic bin. The CVAN also had secondary fire damage on the corresponding interior side where heat from the fire had conducted through the steel wall and affected the paint</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">An obvious V pattern was notable on the exterior of the CVAN. The vertex of the V was along the bottom of the CVAN, near a corner of the plastic bin. At the vertex of the V pattern, the paint on the CVAN was noted to have been burned away and bare metal was extant. In areas removed from this area, damage to the painted exterior was less severe. The damage to the paint on exterior of the CVAN followed the usual pattern of discoloration, bubbling, peel-off and exposure of underlying primer, peel-off of primer and exposure of galvanized metal, oxidation of zinc, and exposure of bare base metal corresponding to exposure to increasing temperatures. Thus, bare metal indicated the location of hottest exposure. In typical fashion, the exposed bare metal, steel, had rusted. Consequently, the rusted areas indicate where exposure to the fire heat was greatest.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">The plastic in the bin had largely melted and fallen to the floor around the bin and resolidified when the floor cooled it. Thus, there was a rough crust of resolidified bin plastic around the bin, especially on the side toward the CVAN.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">A check of the contents of the bin and the materials that had fallen to the floor from the bin found that they consisted of cardboard, plastic sheeting,<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_137" aria-label=" Page 137. "/>miscellaneous plastic items, two large blocks of wood, and some dirty cotton shop rags. No containers that may have contained flammable liquids were found. No smoking materials were found. (It is a nonsmoking area that is rigorously enforced.) The cotton shop rags were not oily, and there were no indications of spontaneous combustion in the rags due to reactions with paint thinner, tung oil, or similar. Fire markings on the CVAN and nearby metal bin indicate that the plastic bin was at least three-quarters or more full of fire load materials when it burned.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">The high-energy, mercury vapor lamp directly above the bin was noted to be blown out; that is, the bulb was broken apart and only a portion of it remained in the ceiling fixture. A pattern of bulb envelope glass was noted around the bin, including glass shards on top of the CVAN, nearby toolboxes, tables, and other surfaces. The shape, type, and thickness of the glass pieces indicated that they had originated from the mercury vapor lamp. It was noted that all the glass shards that were undisturbed by fire fighting efforts were dirty on the topside, but clean on the underside. Further, the surface upon which the glass shards lay was clean underneath but dirty with fire debris elsewhere. The effect is sometimes called shadowing.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">The mercury vapor lamp was about 45 feet above the plastic bin. Neglecting air friction, the fall time from the lamp to the bin is about 1.67 seconds. This is not enough time for glowing arc tube materials to cool. Consequently, any hot arc tube materials from the lamp that fell into the bin were sufficiently hot to ignite fire load in the plastic bin.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">It was reported in a statement that the lamp that had blown was observed to be flickering on the Friday before the fire. Flickering indicates that the lamp is at the end of its service life. Darkening or discoloration of the lamp <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_138" aria-label=" Page 138. "/>indicates it has reached the end of its service life. Product literature indicates that the lamps should be replaced before they fail because they have a higher probability of arc tube rupture at the end of service life. Failure often damages the ballast also. </li>
<li class="orderedlist06">Examination of the lamp found that it is a 1,000-watt Sylvania brand, type H36GV-1000-DX R. The transformer, or ballast, for the lamp is rated at 480 volts. Product literature indicates that the rated average life is 24,000 hours, that is, 2 years, 8 months, and 26 days. The approximate initial lumens are 57,500, and the CCT is 6,300 K. There were no screens or covers on the bottoms of the fixtures in the multipurpose facility as is recommended in the 2005 National Electric Code, Section 410.101(A)(5). Examination of the lamp fixture found that it had not been affected by smoke or water from the fire and had not been hit by the stream of water. Product literature indicates that until the environmental temperature is very hot, over 400&#x00B0;F, the lamps are unaffected.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">Examination of the bulb that had broken above the plastic bin found that
<ol class="ol1" type="a">
<li class="ol06">the black glass portion of the socket (below the threads) was cracked,</li>
<li class="ol06">the bottom electrical conducting pad or contactor had two noticeable areas of arcing,</li>
<li class="ol06"> the threaded portion of the socket had carbon tracking along the threads, and</li>
<li class="ol06">the harp that helped support the quartz inner arc tube was temperature affected in the area where the quartz had blown out.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">The box in which replacement lamps come has a warning on it. The warning states &#x201C;that the bulb can unexpectedly rupture due to internal causes or external factors such as a ballast failure or misapplication. An arc tube <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_139" aria-label=" Page .139 "/><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_140" aria-label=" Page 140. "/>can burst and shatter the outer glass bulb resulting in the discharge of glass fragments and extremely hot quartz particles (as high as 1,832&#x00B0;F). In the event of such rupture, THERE IS A RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, BURNS, AND FIRE.&#x201D;</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">A second lamp, which was noted to have burned out but was not ruptured, was also removed from the ceiling area. This lamp was located near the one that ruptured and is visible in the photograph with the plumb line. It is in the row of lamps directly behind the one that ruptured, on the left side of the lamp that ruptured. The outer glass envelope of this second lamp was clouded over, presumably by oxidized arc tube materials. Further, cracks in the black glass base, similar to those observed in the ruptured bulb, were noted.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">A check found that there is no schedule for bulb replacement. Bulbs are replaced on an as-needed basis when they fail. This is true for all areas in the CNS plant where the HID lamps are used. The manufacturer recommends that the lamps be changed out before they fail to avoid damaging the ballast and to avoid stressing the bulb such that it might rupture</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">From the above data, both investigators concluded that the fire was caused by failure of the high-intensity discharge, 1,000-watt lamp bulb located directly above the bin in which the fire occurred. The lamp bulb failed and ruptured, and hot arc tube materials dropped into the bin. The available fire load in the bin then caught fire.</p>
<p class="subheading2ch06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_141" aria-label=" Page 141. "/>Appendix B: Operating Experience Information</p>
<p class="noindent">When CNS was built, mercury vapor high-intensity lamping in the high bay areas of the plant was compatible with the National Electric Code and other applicable standards. A check of the 1984 NEC, for example, found no prohibition related to HID lamping except when flammable gases might be in the area.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1986, OSHA noted that lamps of the metal halide type could experience unexpected rupture of the arc tube. A public hazard information bulletin was issued then, which is still available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1988, Underwriters Laboratory had taken note of the fact that sometimes high-intensity discharge (HID) lamping occasionally sustained internal rupturing of the arc tube. Standard UL1572 was revised to require that lamps meeting this particular specification be able to withstand arc tube rupture.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1997, there were reports that the quartz inner arc tube of HID lamps might unexpectedly rupture and cause fires, burns, and property damage. Consequently, warnings had been placed on the packaging of high-intensity discharge bulb replacements. Some agencies published advisory articles, such as the Pacific Energy Factsheet, that noted HID lamps sometimes sustained arc tube ruptures, especially when the lamps approached their end-of-life service time and had been in continuous use.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning in 2000, NEMA published several advisory white papers relating to arc tube rupture. OSRAM-Sylvania followed suit and also published a number of product warnings concerning mercury vapor R lamps.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2005, the National Electric Code incorporated specific rules concerning the use of such lamping. Essentially, the 2005 NEC requires that, if applicable, such lamps either be the O type, which can withstand an arc tube rupture, or provide guards and barriers that prevent hot rupture debris from dropping down onto flammable materials. With respect to CNS, there are no O type direct bulb replacements for mercury vapor lamps. Changing to O type also requires a change in the ballast.</p>
<p class="subheading2ch06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_142" aria-label=" Page 142. "/>Appendix C: Failure Mechanics and Risk</p>
<p class="ch06f">ARC TUBE FAILURE MECHANICS</p>
<p class="noindent">In high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, such as the 1,000-watt R mercury vapor lamp in this case, the plasma arc generated within the quartz arc tube produces lamp and heat. High-voltage electricity within the arc tube flows from one electrode, through a pressurized gas medium, to another electrode on the other side.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why this type of lamping requires a higher than normal voltage supply, and why it requires a ballast. The ballast performs two functions:</p>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="orderedlist06">It provides a higher than normal voltage needed for the initial strikeover to occur and establish an arc, and</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">It then provides the normal, somewhat lower operating voltage that maintains the arc once it has been established. Essentially, the ballast is a small, two-voltage transformer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps fail for many reasons, of course, including the usual ones associated with poor handling, breakage, misapplication, poor installation, vibration, and so on. The failure mode in this specific case, however, is due to de-vitrification. This is an end-of-life phenomenon.</p>
<p class="indent">De-vitrification is when, over time, the plasma arc within the pressurized quartz arc tube slowly ablates the inner quartz walls of the arc tube. In other words, the plasma arc thins the walls of the arc tube by slowly vaporizing some of the quartz. Consequently, the stresses in the quartz arc tube, due to the internal pressure exerted by the ionizing gas that fills it, increase. Thus, when the arc tube has sufficiently thinned, it can unexpectedly rupture. Because quartz is brittle, it does not yield, stretch. or distend significantly prior to stress failure.</p>
<p class="indent">The arc tube may also rupture in response to small transient stresses caused by the lamp flickering, strikeover, vibrations, or similar. While de-vitrification may not have proceeded sufficiently to cause rupture by itself, additional transient stresses may combine with the existing elevated stress elevations to exceed the rupture strength of the arc tube.</p> 
<p class="indent">The normal, end-of-life failure mode for this bulb is a slow outgassing of pressurized mercury vapor from the arc tube. As gas leaks from the pressurized arc tube, the starting voltage required to accomplish strikeover increases. This is evident by an obvious increase in start-up time when the lamp is first energized, or by dimming. Older lamps produce noticeably less light. At some point, the loss of pressurized gas from the arc tube is sufficient so that there is insufficient voltage available from the ballast for the lamp to accomplish strikeover. At this point the lamp may dimly flicker or simply fail to strikeover and light.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why unexpected arc tube rupture primarily occurs when the lamp is near its end-of-life service time. As noted in product literature, the rated life of this bulb, whether it is 1,000 watts, 400 watts, or 250 watts, is 24,000 hours. This is equivalent to continuous use for 2 years, 8 months, and 26 days. At the rated life, as much as 50% of the lamp population will have failed according to the manufacturer. Consequently, the rated life should be considered the product&#x2019; s mean time to failure under typical conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">When HID lamps such as these are run to failure without being periodically turned off and on, their arc tubes can fail unexpectedly; de-vitri?cation continues until thinning of the quartz tube is suf?cient for rupture to occur. Although a lamp may have leaked enough gas such that it cannot start, it may still have enough gas <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_143" aria-label=" Page 143. "/>in the tube to maintain a plasma arc if it is continually energized. Maintaining arc requires less voltage than initiating arc. If a lamp is turned on and off periodically, however, and the lamp eventually fails to achieve strikeover and no longer lights, the process of de-vitri?cation stops. The risk of unexpected arc tube failure is therefore obviated. </p>
<p class="indent">HID lamps that are run to failure also have a relatively high incidence of ballast failure. It is common to find a burned-out bulb together with a burned-out ballast.</p>
<p class="ch06b">RISK</p>
<p class="noindent">There are three types of risk associated with this type of lamp fixture: fire and explosion, introduction of foreign material into sensitive systems, and personal injury.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted in the previous section, the risk of unexpected failure of an HID lamp is maximum when older type HID lamps are run to failure and are not periodically turned on and off. This had been the practice at CNS prior to March 14, 2005.</p>
<p class="indent">By turning HID lamps on and off occasionally, the lamps that are near their end of service life do not turn back on. If some of these lamps have thinned arc tubes, they will not be further subjected to transient stresses associated with flickering or a hard start. Thus, they fail to start before they fail from arc tube rupture.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk can be further minimized if the older type HID lamps are replaced prior to their end-of-life failure through a preventive maintenance program. Since it is known that perhaps 50% of the lamps fail after 24,000 hours of service, replacing lamps when they have sustained perhaps 20,000 hours of service will lessen the risk of unexpected arc tube failure. Replacement of lamps that have noticeably dimmed also reduces risk of unexpected failure. Dimming is a symptom that a lamp is approaching its end-of-life service time.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk can be almost eliminated if newer O type lamps replace the older type HID lamps. This type of lamp is designed to contain an arc tube rupture. Unfortunately, there is no one-for-one O type lamp replacement for HID mercury vapor lamps. If a type O lamp is substituted, an O type ballast has to be also substituted. Alternately, risk can be almost eliminated if the HID lamp fixture is equipped with a guard or barrier that prevents debris from an arc tube rupture falling onto combustible materials.</p>
<p class="indent">These two methods, replacement by O type lamps and ballasts or the installation of barriers to prevent hot arc tube debris from falling, are both recommended in the 2005 National Electric Code, Article 410.101(A)(5).</p>
<p class="subheading2ch06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_144" aria-label=" Page 144. "/>Coal Dust Explosion at 230-Megawatt Coal Plant</p>
<p class="ch06f">ABSTRACT</p>
<p class="noindent">This report explains how a coal dust explosion occurred at a 230-megawatt coal-fired power plant in the continental United States. The explosion occurred during start-up of one unit of the two-unit plant, which was being put back online after a scheduled outage. No one was hurt in the explosion. However, the precipitator, the bag house, and portions of the boiler, especially the area around the economizer, were damaged. Direct costs to repair the unit were estimated to be $6 to 8 million, and one unit of the plant was down for 3 months for repairs. The cause of the explosion was a combination of equipment and procedural deficiencies.</p>
<p class="ch06d">PURPOSE</p>
<p class="noindent">This is a case study of how a coal dust explosion occurred in a medium-sized coal-fired power plant located in the continental United States.</p>
<p class="ch06d">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p class="noindent">The generating capacity of the plant is 230 net megawatts from two units. The stack height of both units is 178 feet. The full coal capacity of unit 1 is 66 tons per hour, and the full coal capacity of unit 2 is 78 tons per hour. The unit 1 boiler was put online in the early 1960s. Unit 2&#x2019; s boiler was put online in the late 1960s.</p>
<p class="indent">The fuel normally used is sub-bituminous, low-sulfur western Wyoming coal that is mined from the Powder River Basin area. For start-up, however, sufco coal is used. Sufco has a slightly higher heating value of 11,400 BTU/pound. The coal piles are not covered and are exposed to the weather.</p>
<p class="indent">The explosion occurred during start-up of unit 1. The start-up followed a scheduled spring outage. No one was injured in the explosion. The explosion, however, caused approximately $6 to 8 million of damage, and the unit did not operate for several months while repairs were made.</p>
<p class="ch06d">FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">The explosion occurred on a regular workday just after the spring outage at 9:25 p.m. local time. Prior to the start-up, it had rained and the coal pile was wet.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the incident report, the X coal feeder was started at 7:20 p.m. At 7:30 p.m. operators reported &#x201C;bridging&#x201D; and plugging in the X feeder. Because of that, operators started the Y feeder at 7:31 p.m. Operators finally established a consistent coal flow at 8:08 p.m. in the X feeder.</p>
<p class="indent">A bucket sample of processed sufco coal was obtained from the start-up pile. It had the same moisture content as the coal used on the day of the explosion. The processed coal could be manually compressed into a softball-sized ball, and the ball easily retained its shape even when tossed gently. It was obvious that when wet, the processed coal had a high degree of cohesion.</p>
<p class="indent">Operators had problems with ignition throughout the start-up process and never established a good coal fire. The igniter in Y was shifted over to X. Despite several attempts, no continuous coal fire was established until 8:59 p.m., and this was not a good fire. The operator reported that the fire intermittently flashed and &#x201C;went south.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_145" aria-label=" Page 145. "/>An operator reported that an &#x201C;excellent fire&#x201D; in the boiler was finally established at 9:18 p.m. The temperature in the boiler began to increase then better than at any previous time during the start-up.</p>
<p class="indent">The boiler was purged of ignition natural gas twice prior to the explosion. The first purge began at 8:34 p.m. and lasted 6 minutes. The second purge began at 8:44 p.m. and lasted for 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometime after 9:18 p.m., an employee reported that he observed black smoke leaking from a side door at the southeast corner of the precipitator. Operators decided that the coal feed would be held steady until a replacement door was found. After that, fuel flow would be secured and the boiler purged so that the door could be replaced.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 9:18 p.m. and when the explosion occurred at 9:25 p.m., an operator reported that when securing the X cyclone, the tertiary air damper was discovered stuck in the closed position. An instrument and control technician was dispatched to fix the damper. The technician worked on the damper while the fire was in the Y cyclone and fixed the problem. When he fixed the problem, he cycled the damper open and closed. The technician reported that about 30 seconds after he cycled the damper open and closed, the explosion occurred.</p> 
<p class="indent">Within 4 minutes after the explosion, the igniter gas was secured and the forced draft fan was secured. A head count was conducted and all personnel were accounted for. Operators then secured unit 1.</p>
<p class="indent">During an inspection walkdown after the explosion, the author noted unburned coal dust within the economizer, in the discharge area of the economizer, and in varying amounts all the way to the bag house. Within the bag house he observed a light layer of unburned coal dust on top of previously deposited ash. The ash is typically a tan or light brown color; the unburned coal dust is black.</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after the walkdown, slowly increasing elevations of carbon monoxide were detected in the air pathways downstream of the cyclone furnace burners, particularly in the pathway just preceding the economizer area. Processed coal smoulders were still being found and extinguished within the flue gas pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">The most severe structural damage occurred at elevation 1513, which is downstream of the economizer, shown in <a href="#fig6_8">Figure 6.8.</a> Elevation 1513 is also noted on the attached schematic of the boiler. This is where structural beams and members <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_146" aria-label=" Page 146. "/>deflected the most. Below this area, the author observed that surfaces normal to flue gas flow had been blown downward; above this elevation, the author observed that surfaces had been lifted and dropped down. Lateral damage, that is, damage normal to the flue gas flow, was severest in this same area and lessened in severity either upstream or downstream from this area.</p>
<p class="indent">The resulting pressure wave of the explosion traveled downstream into the precipitator and then into the bag house. The pressure wave rebounded in the bag house and caused the bag house to sustain some structural damage (<a href="#fig6_9">Figure 6.9</a>). Along the way, the pressure wave also distended some expansion joints.</p>

<p class="indent">After the explosion, no one reported residual smell of natural gas odorant in the area where the explosion initiated.</p>
<p class="indent">The operating parameters of the plant leading up to, during, and after the explosion were reviewed, especially Y and X coal flow, SO furnace temperature, NO furnace temperature, opacity, total airflow, Z cyclone total air, Y cyclone total air, and X cyclone total air. The following items were noteworthy:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">At the time of the explosion and slightly preceding it, the opacity of the flue gas near the stack exit was 100%. From 9:20 to 9:25 p.m., the opacity was near or greater than 80%. During the same time that the opacity was increasing from 80% to 100%, the south furnace temperature and the north furnace temperature were rising.</li>
<li class="dotch01">During the two purges, the first at 8:34 p.m. and the second at 8:44 p.m., the opacity significantly dropped. Between purges, the opacity jumped up from 25% to about 55%.</li>
<li class="dotch01"> From 9:00 p.m. to the time of the explosion, 9:25 p.m., the total airflow was about 240,000 pounds per hour.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ch06d">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent">The explosion was not caused by the ignition of combustible gas. The two successive purges that totaled 13 minutes were more than sufficient to disperse any <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_147" aria-label=" Page 147. "/>accumulated unburned igniter gas within the flue gas pathway. A simple airflow calculation indicates that 13 minutes is more than enough time for all the air in the boiler flue gas pathway to be replaced several times with fresh air.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, no residual mercaptan odorant smell was noted in the areas heavily damaged by the explosion. Any igniter gas that might have collected in these enclosed areas would have had enough residence time for odor to be retained in the fibrous insulation materials.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent">Operators and personnel did not observe any flashback of a fire front or fireball typical of a gas deflagration. In gas deflagrations, the fire front typically follows the fuel trail from the point of ignition back to the source. The author observed no singeing, burn damages, burn &#x201C;shadows,&#x201D; or similar fire front effects between the point where the explosion was most severe, i.e., the greatest overpressure, and the cyclone furnace area. There was no continuous, explosive elevation, gas trail from elevation 1513 to the cyclone furnace.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent">As previously noted, the point of ignition was near or at elevation 1513. Damage was most severe at elevation 1513 as evident by bowing and displacement of structural beams and members. Typically, the point of ignition is near or at the location where the deflagration pressure is greatest. When the structure is more or less regular, this means that the point of ignition is near, or at, the location where structural damage is greatest.</p>
<p class="indent">The ability of the boiler to confine the deflagration overpressure was limited. The flue gas pathway was essentially a long rectangular tube with both ends unsealed and open to the atmosphere. High, localized overpressure easily blew out panels between structural beams and members. Consequently, the overpressure front resulting from the explosion rapidly diminished in effect with distance from the point of ignition. Because the boiler flue gas path could not effectively contain the overpressure, there was no displacement of the point of heaviest damage from the point of initial ignition; they were coincident.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="indent">The fuel source for the explosion was processed coal dust. Unburned coal dust was found throughout the flue gas pathway from the cyclone furnace to the end of the bag house. Just prior to the explosion, instruments indicated that the opacity at the stack was 100%. This indicates that air exiting the stack was heavily laden with black coal dust. Further, there was an eyewitness report that black smoke was observed exiting through the door on the southeast corner of the precipitator. This door is located directly downstream of where the explosion center was located. The eyewitness observation corroborates that just prior to the explosion, the air in the vicinity of the economizer was laden with unburned, suspended coal dust.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following related items are excerpted from reference 1, pp. 218&#x2013;219 and 224:</p>
<p class="indenteg1">For high volatile bituminous coals, the minimum explosive concentration lies between 50 and 100 g/cubic meter. The upper explosive limit is not well defined, but is above 4000 g/cubic meter. (This last figure equates to about 8.8 pounds per cubic meter.)</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="dotch01">Prevention of coal dust explosions by the reduction of oxygen does not occur until the oxygen elevation is less than 13%.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The high temperature of drying air often can provide enough heat to ignite coal accumulation&#x2026;</li>
<li class="dotch01">The minimum ignition temperature of a coal dust cloud can range from 425 C for dried lignites to 800 C for certain anthracite coals. Bituminous coals typically ignite somewhere between 500 C and 625 C. The minimum ignition temperature for the generation of a smouldering fire in a coal dust layer <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_148" aria-label=" Page 148. "/>is much lower, however, and certain bituminous coals may be ignited at temperatures as low as 160 C.</li>
<li class="dotch01">The smaller the particle size, the greater the exposed surface area and the tendency to undergo spontaneous heating.</li>
<li class="dotch01">Volatile gases resulting from thermal decomposition when the coal is heated can cause a serious explosion in a confined area such as a silo or surge bin.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 240,000 pounds of air per hour, the amount of air being supplied at the time of the explosion, is equivalent to a volumetric flow rate of 3,137,000 cubic feet per hour, or 52,287 cubic feet per minute.</p>
<p class="indent">The cross-sectional area around the cyclone is 336 square feet, and the cross-sectional area at elevation 1502 and higher is 1,056 square feet. The approximate airflow velocities in these areas were 2.6 and 1.5 feet/second, respectively, at STP. At temperatures of about 200&#x00B0;F, the airflow velocities would have been about 3.2 and 1.87 feet/second, respectively. At these velocities, it would have taken air approximately 25 seconds or so to travel in a straight lie from the cyclone to the 1513 elevation.</p>
<p class="indent">The above corroborates well the time estimate provided by the instrument and control technician: that he heard the explosion about 30 seconds after the tertiary air damper was cycled. Operating the tertiary air damper modulates airflow into the cyclone and can dislodge partially burned coal fuel particles still in residence in the cyclone. Any particles so loosened would have taken that amount of time to travel to the coal dust cloud and ignite it.</p>
<p class="ch06d">ACCIDENT SCENARIO</p>
<p class="noindent">The evidence indicates that the following occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">The coal was wet and sticky. This not only caused handling problems, but also tended to quench combustion in the cyclone. When wet, the coal particles did not mix well with the air in the cyclone; the coal fuel formed large clumps and was heavier than the particles for which the cyclone was designed to handle.</p>
<p class="indent">Coal fuel was put into the cyclone, but only a portion of it was burned away by the igniter gas. The rest stayed resident in the system. The two purges that were executed purged the excess natural gas from the system well. This, however, did not purge the excess wet coal fuel that was resident in the system.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of residual heat from start-up attempts and the airflow from start-up attempts and purges finally dried the excess wet coal that had been resident within the system. This coal fuel, once it finally dried out, was then free to be picked up by the airflow and formed a dust cloud that traveled through the system. This is documented in opacity measurements, witness observations, and the fact that large amounts of unburned coal dust were found throughout the boiler system after the explosion. An opacity of 100% is sufficient to support an explosion.</p>
<p class="indent">When the instrument and control technician cycled the tertiary air damper, this caused the airflow in the cyclone to modulate. This likely caused a partially burned ember or spark from the cyclone to dislodge and move into the airstream. It then followed the normal flue gas pathway. When it reached elevation 1513, it touched off the explosion.</p>
<p class="ch06d">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">The explosion that occurred was caused by the ignition of unburned coal dust carryover. Ignition difficulties of wet fuel during start-up allowed the excessive carryover to occur.</p>

<p class="noindent">A root cause team, which had been assembled to investigate all aspects of the accident, found the following four key equipment and procedural issues had contributed to the accident:</p>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="orderedlist06">Equipment modifications performed during the spring outage may have affected the firing characteristics of the boiler igniters.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">An air damper was found to be stuck in the closed position during start-up.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">Less than adequate operating instructions were available to guide the operators during start-up with the low temperature gains experienced during fuel admission.</li>
<li class="orderedlist06">The failure of the secondary air shut-off damper created a distraction for the operator and resulted in the omission of completing certain operating guide elements.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Subsequent to the above, a burner management team was formed to concentrate solely on addressing the deficiencies found by the root cause team.</p>

<p class="ch06e">Randall Noon, PE</p>
<p class="ch06e">Cooper Nuclear Station</p>
<p class="ch06e"> August 2, 2001</p>
<p class="ch06d"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_151" aria-label=" Page 151. "/>BRIEF BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p class="noindent">The A control rod drive pump failed at Cooper Nuclear Station on August 24, 2001. It failed due to high vibration elevations in the outboard bearing, especially in the axial direction, and poor pump performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Output pressure of the pump dropped over a short period of time, and the pump sounded different to the operators who routinely checked it on rounds. Subsequent vibration measurements confirmed that the different sound was due to high vibration elevations generated at the outboard bearing.</p>
<p class="indent">The pump failed almost 1 year to the day after the outboard bearing had been field installed.</p>
<p class="ch06d">OBSERVATIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">The two control rod drive pumps at Cooper Nuclear Station are both rated for 1,600 psig discharge at 79 gpm and 4,210 rpm. They were manufactured by the Worthington Pump Company and are type 2WTF810.</p>
<p class="indent">The outboard bearing configuration on the control rod drive pump consists of two ball-type roller bearings installed side by side on the pump shaft. One of the outboard bearings was provided for examination. The rest of this report concerns that particular bearing.</p>
<p class="indent">The bearings have a 20&#x00B0; contact angle that is intended to handle both radial and axial loads. From the design of the bearings and the nature of the pump, a multistage high-pressure centrifugal type, the anticipated radial loads carried by the outboard bearing are greater than the anticipated axial loads.</p>
<p class="indent">As shown in the cover page photograph (<a href="#fig6_11">see Figure 6.11</a>), the outboard bearing is type SKF 7405 BCBM. Both races have ten balls per race.</p>

<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 6.11</b><span class="space"/>Inner race.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The ball diameter was measured to be about 0.593 inches (15.06 mm). The cage appears to be made of brass or bronze, while the inner and outer races are standard hardened and ground steel. The measured bore diameter is 0.982 inches (24.87 mm). The inner race of the outboard bearing, shown in photograph 1 on the next page (<a href="#fig6_12">see Figure 6.12</a>), is straw colored along the ball groove and around the bore. This indicates that the bearing had been running at a significantly elevated temperature for some time.</p>

</figure>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_152" aria-label=" Page 152. "/>Further, the wear pattern on the inner race where the balls contact the groove is not symmetric; it is tilted. The wear is above the expected contact circle along the ball groove on one side of the race, and 180&#x00B0; away from that location it is below the expected contact circle. This is an indicator of misalignment within the bearing when it was operating.</p>
<p class="indent">Examination of the cage under low magnification, shown in <a href="#fig6_12">Figure 6.12</a>, found that the slots for the balls had heavier than normal wear marks where the balls contact the inner surface of the slots. Further, the wear marks were not symmetric, which also indicates a misalignment present when the bearing was in use.</p>
<p class="indent">The outer race, shown in <a href="#fig6_13">Figure 6.13</a>, was not significantly straw colored. This indicates that it had not yet heated up significantly and that the primary point of heat generation was between the balls and the inner race. Examination of the outside diameter of the bearing found points where fretting between the outer <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_153" aria-label=" Page 153. "/>diameter of the bearing and the pump bore was very pronounced, and areas where contact between the outer race and the casing bore was light.</p>

<p class="ch06d">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic equation that describes the life of a roller bearing is given by the following:</p>

<p class="noindent">where</p>
<p class="noindent">L = rated life in millions of revolutions <span class="block"/>P = equivalent load on the bearing, both radial and axial <span class="block"/>C = constant associated with the bearing design</p>
<p class="indentc05">With respect to the equivalent load on the bearing, P, there is a second equation that defines that factor:</p>
<p class="roman">(ii)

</p>
<p class="indent">where</p>
<p class="indent">X = 0.70, factor for this type of bearing</p>
<p class="indent">V = 1.0, factor for this type of bearing</p>
<p class="indent">Y = 1.63, factor for this type of bearing</p>
<p class="indent">F<sub>R</sub> = radial load</p>
<p class="indent">F<sub>A</sub> = axial load</p>
<p class="roman">(iii)
<m:math display='block'><m:mrow><m:mtext>L&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;(C)3/(0</m:mtext><m:mtext>.7&#x00A0;FR&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;1</m:mtext><m:mtext>.63&#x00A0;FA)3</m:mtext></m:mrow>
</m:math></p>
<p class="indent">Inspection of equation (iii) indicates that when axial forces are present, they decrease the life of the bearing exponentially and have a greater influence on shortening bearing life than radial loads. In fact, a unit of axial load has more than twice the effect on shortening bearing life as a unit of radial load due to the ratio of the coefficients.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, consider the case where the radial force is unity, the axial force is zero, and the bearing life is L&#x2019; . If the axial force becomes just 10% as strong as the radial force, then the life of the bearing becomes 0.53L&#x2019; . In other words, the expected life of the bearing will be halved.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, a reasonable bearing life for CRD pump bearings is 8 years. This is based upon operating experience at CNS as documented in the CWIT database. If the bearing only lasts 1 year instead, as it did in this case, the equivalent load, P, likely has doubled.</p>
<p class="indent">From design considerations, especially the 20&#x00B0; contact angle, it is presumed that under normal circumstances the ratio of radial load to axial load in that bearing is about 3 to 1. Considering the X and Y coefficients in the previous equation, if the radial load remained the same but the axial load increased 3.2 times its typical amount, this would double the equivalent load, P, and shorten the life of the bearing by a factor of 8. If this were to have occurred, it would have produced at the same time a noticeably higher elevation of vibrations in the axial direction.</p><p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_154" aria-label=" Page 154. "/>In this respect, it was reported that when the outboard bearing was installed a year ago, it did initially exhibit higher than expected vibrations in the axial direction. Since the vibrations, however, were considered to be within the acceptable range, the pump was put into service and operated. As previously noted, just before the pump was taken offline, the axial vibrations were noted to be significantly higher than normal. Both of these reports indicate that higher than normal axial forces were occurring in the bearing when it was operating.</p>
<p class="indent">Examination of the bearing found that it had been overheating long enough to generally give the inner race an overall straw color. This indicates excessive friction between the balls and the races. Also, wear markings observed in both the bearing inner race and the cage indicate that the bearing inner and outer races were misaligned with each other. Lastly, examination of the outer race&#x2019; s outside diameter (OD) found evidence of significant fretting at certain locations around the OD.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, all of the observations also indicate that higher than normal axial forces were present when the bearing was operating, and that these excessive axial forces were produced by a misalignment in the outboard bearing.</p>
<p class="indent">An inquiry was made to determine whether a check for perpendicularly was done after this bearing was installed. Such a check would typically be accomplished using a machinist&#x2019; s dial indicator and magnetic base mounted such that by either spinning the shaft or spinning the bearing, run-out on the bearing can be measured. The inquiry found that the work procedure for field installation of the bearing apparently did not include such a perpendicularly check.</p>
<p class="ch06d">CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">The outboard bearing of the A CRD pump failed after just 1 year of service because the outboard bearing was out of alignment tolerance. This likely occurred when it was field installed.</p>
<p class="indent">This deficiency could have been detected and the premature failure avoided if after installation a simple check for perpendicularity tolerance had been done. It is recommended that this step, or one similar to it, be added to the shop installation procedure for this type of bearing.</p>
