<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_1">Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">By the way, Erle Stanley Gardner, an amazingly prolific fiction and nonfiction writer and the author of the Perry Mason mystery book series, actually did practice criminal law. Later in life, Mr. Gardner championed the cases of potentially innocent people who had been wrongly sent to prison in a project called the Court of Last Resort.</p>
<p class="indent">I am indebted to Jon J. Nordby, PhD, D-ABMDI, for the following excellent case study that constitutes this final chapter. Dr. Nordby is a nationally noted forensic scientist and consultant, the author of <i>Dead Reckoning: The Art of Forensic Detection,</i> and the co-editor of the textbook <i>Forensic Science: An Introduction to Scientific and Investigative Techniques,</i> which is now in its third edition.</p>
<p class="indent">While the three case studies provided previously in <a href="16_chapter06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> have an obvious engineering slant, in this chapter Dr. Nordby ably narrates a compelling case study about how the same fundamental scientific method and ancillary principles were used to evaluate evidence related to a heinous crime.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_2">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_2">The Scene</h2>
<p class="noindent">The state&#x2019; s renowned police expert had seen it all before: experience gleaned from years spent attending to the aftermath of murder. An expert in crime scenes, bloodstains, firearms, and all things to do with homicide, he made his determinations at the scene quickly and concisely after walking through the small single-story house, looking at the ransacked living quarters, seeing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_156" aria-label=" Page 156. "/>the dead woman lying face up on the kitchen floor, and examining the bloodstains he found on the husband&#x2019; s face.</p>
<p class="indent">His conclusions were firm and unyielding. The crime scene was staged merely to look like the work of an intruder; the blood on the husband&#x2019; s glasses told him the story of domestic murder. The husband was guilty. He shot his unsuspecting wife in the back with a shotgun sabot slug, sending her into the next world with a single blast from his 12-gauge while she worked at the kitchen sink. The expert gleaned facts sufficient to craft the end of another violent story. He told the photographer to document the scene, as he packed up his notebook and left through the front door.</p>
<p class="indent">When he left for the city to write his report, he had been at the rural mountain house about 2 hours, give or take an hour. Only the photographer and three patrol officers, including the first officer to respond to the original 911 call, remained awaiting the deputy coroner. The deputy coroner&#x2019; s chief duty involved collecting and transporting the body for autopsy. The lead detective had taken the prisoner into custody and transported him to jail pending his formal arraignment.</p>
<p class="indent">The photographer looked around for something other than the body and the blood to document, like a shotgun, for example. He didn&#x2019; t see one. Maybe someone removed it along with the prisoner. He got the patrol officer&#x2019; s notes and began a hasty review to catch up on the case while he loaded his camera.</p>
<p class="indent">The husband had made the 911 call at 7:12 p.m. He called from a neighbor&#x2019; s house, which was about a 5-minute walk or a 3-minute dash from his own. The kitchen phone dangled from one remaining sheet-rock screw still stuck into the wall. The husband told the 911 operator that his wife had been shot&#x2014;  he said he knelt in front of her, felt for a heartbeat, saw she was dead, tried to use the dysfunctional phone, ran to use the neighbor&#x2019; s phone, and called 911 for help.</p>
<p class="indent">The operator kept him on the line until the first patrol officer arrived at 7:35 p.m. The officer&#x2019; s narrative had not yet been copied onto the appropriate report form. The photographer looked up from the officer&#x2019; s notebook, toward the kitchen, into the adjoining dining area, and through to the living room/family room. He moved slowly through the small house taking photos as he went.</p>
<p class="indent">The dining room table was pushed against the wall with two of its four chairs tipped precariously on spindly legs. The end tables just inside the living room, drawers open, spilled miscellaneous contents onto the beige carpet. The buffet doors were open as were the desk drawers. Papers littered the proximate surrounding flat surfaces.</p>
<p class="indent">The home entertainment center displayed empty slots and protruding tangles of wire once feeding now-absent components. An empty holster and a box of 357 cartridges lay beside the open coat-closet door. His flash helped <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_157" aria-label=" Page 157. "/>illuminate the details for his camera. He changed rolls of film and moved on through the residence.</p>
<p class="indent">The bedroom revealed a neatly made bed that had become a dumping ground for drawers pulled from an oak highboy. Their various contents, including male and female clothing, appeared randomly strewn about the room. The open closet door barely concealed a pile of possessions once suspended from plastic hangers.</p>
<p class="indent">The husband had listed various missing property, including audio components, a revolver, a hunting rifle, some jewelry, and some cash from the bedroom. He had said he did not own a shotgun.</p>
<p class="indent">The arrival of the deputy coroner provided the photographer with his opportunity to document matters in the kitchen. The body and the kitchen area had already occupied most of the official attention allotted to the case: that, and of course the husband&#x2014;  including his hands, his clothing, and his glasses. The sabot had entered the decedent&#x2019; s back and exited along the midline of her chest.</p>
<p class="indent">Three holes appeared through the back of her sweater when the body was moved by the deputy coroner&#x2014;  the sabot had separated as designed, leaving one hole made by the slug, and two holes made by the separating sabot<a href="#fn7_1" id="rfn7_1">.*</a> The front of her chest was covered with blood.</p>
<p class="indent">Bloodstains of varying sizes appeared on the arms and the lower waistband of the once-white fuzzy sweater. The slug and the two halves of the sabot appeared on the counter beside the sink. They would need to be collected and taken into evidence. And a thorough search would have to be made for the murder weapon.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_3">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_3">Further Search of the Premises</h2>
<p class="noindent">Searching the property took the better part of three full days. The family truck was found parked near the garage with the passenger door open, and the contents of the glove box strewn onto the bench seat and floor. No shotgun was found anywhere on the property, and none of the items reported to be missing from the house by the husband were found either.</p>
<p class="indent">Officers also confirmed that the car pool had dropped off the defendant in front of his house at about 6:55 p.m. the night of the murder.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec7_4">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_158" aria-label=" Page 158. "/>The State&#x2019; s Expert Reconstructs the Murder from the Clues</h2>
<p class="noindent">Like many official reports, the one produced by the state&#x2019; s expert was long on inferences and short on data. The inferences forming the heart of a crime scene or shooting reconstruction remain only as good as the supporting data together with its sound scientific analysis. Both the data and the analysis offered in this report were found wanting.</p>
<p class="indent">The report stated unequivocally that the disarray in the small house resulted from the actions of the husband. These actions, the report intoned, were designed to be interpreted as the actions of some unknown intruder who had killed the decedent, robbed the residence, and departed undiscovered.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, the report indicated, they merely exposed the husband&#x2019; s obvious but clumsy plan to cloak his own murderous actions. So the husband shot his wife as she worked in the kitchen, then he proceeded to conceal his nefarious act by pulling out drawers, opening doors, and strewing the household contents around each room. Support produced for this conjecture centered on some inadequately documented broken glass.</p>
<p class="indent">The ballistics of the sabot and the bloodstain analysis dovetailed, according to the report, to prove the husband&#x2019; s guilt. The report included a diagram of what purported to be the trajectory of the fatal shot. The expert&#x2019; s assemblage of physical evidence, including the bloodstains on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses, proved that the defendant shot the victim in the back.</p>
<p class="indent">When taken into custody, the husband had small bloodstains on his glasses as well as bloodstains on the palms of both hands. Wipe stains appeared over the pockets of his Levis. No other bloodstains of any significance were noted in the report.</p>
<p class="indent">The stains on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses were referred to as high-velocity backspatter. The report described the stains on the glasses as being &#x201C;1 mm or less&#x201D; in diameter. It further explained that such small stains &#x201C;can <i>only</i> be produced through gunshot impact.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">These high-velocity stains result when a bullet strikes a blood source and the resulting impact has sufficient energy to produce small droplets, which fly backward toward the muzzle of the weapon firing the shot. The only mechanism with sufficient energy to produce such high-velocity spatter, at least according to some readers and some writers of the bloodstain pattern analysis literature, is a gunshot.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that these stains appeared on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses offered the only support for the expert&#x2019; s ballistics analysis: he concluded that the shot was fired at a close range&#x2014;  close enough for these tiny droplets to leave the target and strike the defendant&#x2019; s glasses at 90&#x00B0;.</p>
<p class="indent">The claim often advanced is that this high-velocity backspatter travels about 20 to 36 inches from the target (blood source) toward the muzzle. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_159" aria-label=" Page 159. "/>round nature of the stains, the report claimed, supports this angle of impact at 90&#x2014;  when blood drops strike a surface, their angle can be determined by the shape of the stain.</p>
<p class="indent">If the drop is round, the angle is 90&#x0B0;. If the drop is oblong, then the length and width of the stain can be used to compute the exact angle of impact according to a well-established formula: angle of impact = sin<sup>-1</sup>(W/L), where W = the width of the stain in millimeters and L = the length of the stain in millimeters. The round stains, each 1 mm or less in diameter, absolutely prove that the defendant fired the fatal shot, the report concluded.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the report emphasized the size of these stains appearing on the glasses&#x2014;  each stain on the glasses was reported to be less than 1 mm in diameter. The scientific claim underlying these conclusions remains unstated: the report&#x2019; s author assumed that only high-velocity bloodstains<a href="#fn7_2" id="rfn7_2">*</a> created by gunshot could produce such small bloodstains.</p>
<p class="indent">The above assumption has been repeated frequently in courts and has gone mostly without question. This assumption joins the others in the report, which remained untested by the expert. Nevertheless, the report concludes by offering a &#x201C;crime scene reconstruction&#x201D; based upon the data selected for this analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">The reconstruction provided in the report offered an explanation for each of the significant facts of the case: The disarray in the house resulted from the husband&#x2019; s efforts to &#x201C;stage the scene&#x201D; to make the death appear to be the result of a robbery gone bad; the bloodstains on the husband&#x2019; s glasses resulted from high-velocity backspatter, which could only come from his firing a shotgun sabot, which struck his wife&#x2019; s back; the husband&#x2019; s presence at the scene simply underscores his involvement in the crime.</p>
<p class="indent">When initially questioned by officers and detectives about the inability to find the murder weapon at the scene, the state&#x2019; s expert&#x2019; s reply was, &#x201C;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,&#x201D; a quip some attribute to the patriarch of bloodstain pattern analysis, Herb McDonell. It states that our simple inability to discover or develop specific evidence in a case does not somehow <i>mean by itself or prove independently</i> that the evidence was never there to be discovered in the first place. However, inadequate science cannot be covered by clever quips, no matter how they were originally intended. Indeed, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_160" aria-label=" Page 160. "/>problem with the scientific work in this case remained the scientific work itself, beginning with the data.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_5">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_5">Revisiting the Scene Science: The Problem of Data</h2>
<p class="noindent">Viewing and approaching the scientific project merely in an adversarial light&#x2014;  like two teams clashing on a sporting field with an eye only toward winning the battle of &#x201C;our results vs. their results&#x201D;&#x2014;  destroys any potential for the impartial examination of evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, forensic science remains scientific work to be presented in court. This automatically puts the <i>presentation of scientific results and their assessments</i> into an adversarial context&#x2014;  a context in which interested parties become very partial. But the practice of science itself, the science applied to the data in order to reach those results, must never become guided by an eye fixed solely toward some desired or favored outcome based upon extrascientific interests. In science, the data should prevail, and the results should fall within the proper limits of the science applied to these data.</p>
<p class="indent">One potential adversarial problem involves the close associations among interested police investigators, enthusiastic detectives, and ambitious prosecutors with police scientists working in police crime laboratories. This police influence can, at the very least, appear to be a conflict of interest with respect to the practice of independent data assessments and disinterested applications of natural science.<a href="#fn7_2">*</a>If it does not become an actual conflict, this fact is due in no small measure to the individual integrity and scientific professionalism of the specific crime laboratory analyst involved in the case. This chauvinistic attitude, unless circumvented by this individual&#x2019; s moral fortitude, can result not only in the refusal to share data but also in the refusal to explain the specific scientific protocols, techniques, and reasoning applied to derive a particular result.</p>
<p class="indent">These omissions become evident in official reports that present only conclusions and rarely the work involved in their derivation. In this way, one important element of the scientific method, independent assessment either generating mutual support or raising additional doubts, remains still- <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_161" aria-label=" Page 161. "/>born. Scientists hired by the defense can be hampered by the ill will of the prosecutor who retains ultimate control of the evidence.<a href="#fn7_3" id="rfn7_3">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">This adversarial problem is not unique to those experts working with the prosecution. Of course, a similar problem can arise in the close association between defense attorneys and the experts that they hire. Unfortunately, some experts are more anxious to sell their testimony by making it favorable to defense interests rather than to supply independent scientific analyses of independently developed data.</p>
<p class="indent">These ethical issues and the resulting problems for scientific method are by no means novel or exclusive to either the prosecution or the defense. Suffice it to say that ethical lapses, wherever they occur, denigrate the application of scientific method as well as the reputations of those who take ethical shortcuts either for personal gain or for the sake of some independently perceived morally right outcome trotted out to justify such scientific sin.</p>
<p class="indent">The intellectual baggage revealed by the state expert in this case provides additional insights into how scientific method, or at least what may superficially pass for it, can go badly wrong. The data remain the focus of the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Asking questions is always preferred to answering questions, at least when it comes to the initial generation of data. When applying science to the investigation of a crime at a crime scene, an unfortunate cookie-cutter approach to the sciences in the expert&#x2019; s tool box can take hold.</p>
<p class="indent">In this approach, the data are recognized and collected according to nothing less than specific pseudoscientific prejudices seemingly based upon the statistical frequency of some observation rather than upon the observation of actual data discovered and documented at the scene. Such pseudoscientific generalizations can be confused with covering scientific laws, laws supposedly allowing the deduction of particular cases as logical consequences of these scientific laws.</p>
<p class="indent">The data, therefore, become recognized as an instance of the familiar law, and the law then provides the scientific explanation of the data. The potentially inappropriate circular nature of this reasoning remains obvious. One example involves claims about high-velocity bloodstains resulting only from gunshot.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1 mm bloodstains on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses were both <i>recognized </i>as data through the application of this inferential process (less than 1 mm is high velocity; high velocity is only from gunshot; therefore, this blood on the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_162" aria-label=" Page 162. "/>glasses is high velocity from gunshot) and <i>explained</i> as the result of gunshot through this deductive process.</p>
<p class="indent">Scientific methods, however, only begin with the recognition of some data as puzzling: data that requires an explanation. It cannot end with the imposition of an explanation simply imposed at the point of recognition. Of the scientific issues apparent in this case report and expert reconstruction, the high-velocity bloodstains reported on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses remain one of the most informative about scientific method.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_6">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_6">Testing to Develop Scientific Inferences from Data</h2>
<p class="noindent">The blood evidence available in this case included some photos of the scene, the decedent&#x2019; s clothing, the suspect&#x2019; s clothing, and the suspect&#x2019; s glasses. Bloodstains can tell us a great deal about any blood-shedding event. Bloodstain pattern analysis, as a discipline, involves the scientific study of the static consequences resulting from dynamic blood-shedding events.</p>
<p class="indent">As observations, bloodstains must be described and documented. If equivocal mechanisms could produce any given stain pattern, then testing becomes essential. The tests are designed to help determine, if possible, the mechanism that produced the given stains at the scene. Such questions posed about the stains on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses, and on the decedent&#x2019; s sweater, revealed essential information permitting scientifically supported inferences about the shooting event. These inferences replace the apparently circular inferences resulting from the cookie-cutter approach to applied science described above.<a href="#fn7_4" id="rfn7_4">*</a></p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_7">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_7">Scientific Inferences from the Decedent&#x2019; s Sweater</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first task involves observation, followed closely by description. I observed the decedent&#x2019; s sweater, front and back. I noted that the stains on the front, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_163" aria-label=" Page 163. "/>where the slug exited, appeared to be of several different types: they were the typical soaking and wicking stains from exposure to a plentiful blood source, but there were also drip stains and cast-off stains&#x2014;  stains with satellite spatter from vertical drops and stains with tails showing an arc of movement throughout their deposition (see <a href="#fig7_1">Figures 7.1</a> and<a href="#fig7_3">7.4</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig7_1" class="img">
<img src="../images/fig7_1.jpg" alt=""/>
<figcaption>
<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 7.1 and 7.2</b><span class="space"/>Stains on the lower right quadrant of the garment show drip stains; the midline and the lower left quadrant show soaking and wicking stains.<span class="space"/></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure id="fig7_3" class="img">
<img src="../images/fig7_3.jpg" alt=""/>
<figcaption>
<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 7.3 and 7.4</b><span class="space"/>Stains on the right arm exhibit directionality as well as a smaller size characteristic of stains cast off from some moving blood source. The photo on the right shows the mixture of these stains&#x2014;the larger drips with some smaller cast-off stains.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">This meant that the various stains observed on the front of the sweater resulted from different mechanisms. These mechanisms included soaking and wicking, dripping from a blood source higher than the sweater&#x2019; s surface, and droplets cast off from some blood source moving in specific directions above the sweater&#x2019; s surface. So multiple events had occurred to deposit bloodstains on the front of the sweater&#x2014;  no single shooting event alone could explain all these different stains.</p>
<p class="indent">Examining the back of the sweater also revealed compelling bloodstain data. Recording overall macro observations is critical, but simply looking at bloodstains with the unaided eye seldom reveals sufficient detail to help classify and distinguish different bloodstain patterns. Unfortunately, the state expert&#x2019; s work did not include microscopic examinations, and consequently included no photomicrographs of any relevant bloodstains. The failure to make adequate or detailed observations becomes a familiar flaw with the so- called cookie-cutter method: There is no point raising any further questions when the answers have already been supplied by the generalization applied.</p>
<p class="indent">The back of the sweater presented key pieces of information about the shooting, including the three entrance holes&#x2014;  one from the slug and one from each of the two sides of the sabot. But it also revealed another bloodstain pattern visible only microscopically, a pattern that raised further questions about the ballistics issues involved in the shooting (<a href="#fig7_5">see Figures 7.5 and 7.6</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig7_5" class="img">
<img src="../images/fig7_5.jpg" alt=""/>
<figcaption>
<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 7.5 and 7.6</b><span class="space"/>The overall views seen here at the left and right show evi-dence of the soaking and wicking stains as well as the holes in the sweater made by the slug and the sabot, which guided the slug through the 12-gauge shotgun&#x2019;s barrel. Recall that the shotgun itself was never recovered.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">The sweater was designed with multiple fuzzy fibers covering the entire white surface as part of its weave pattern&#x2014;  a &#x201C;shaggy&#x201D; sweater. Under the microscope, near each of the entrance holes, small droplets of blood appear stuck to these fibers (<a href="#fig7_7">see Figures 7.7 and 7.8</a>). Recall that when a projectile strikes a blood source, the impact produces small blood drops that travel <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_164" aria-label=" Page 164. "/>back toward the source of the projectile. This phenomenon is called backspatter. It is commonly observed around gunshot wounds of entrance.</p>
<figure id="fig7_7" class="img">
<img src="../images/fig7_7.jpg" alt=""/>
<figcaption>
<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 7.7 and 7.8</b><span class="space"/>These photomicrographs show backspattered blood drop-lets captured by the sweater&#x2019;s fibers. Sometimes these small blood drops can be mistaken for burned and unburned gunpowder. In this case a simple analytical test using x-ray fluorescence spectrophotometry will settle the issue: No nitrates and no other elements characteristic of gunpowder are present in the sample.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="indent">If the gun recovered at a shooting scene has small blood droplets present in and around the barrel, these data can be used to help estimate the muz- zle-to-target distance. Generally, by experiment, these blood droplets travel backward from the target no more than 20 to 36 inches.<a href="#fn7_5" id="rfn7_5">*</a> If a shooter has blood droplets on his face, hands, arms, or chest, and if these droplets originate from such backspatter, then we have reason to believe that the shooter&#x2019; s face, hands, arms, or chest was 20 to 36 inches from the blood source when the bullet or projectile struck the target.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_165" aria-label=" Page 165. "/>However, these fibers on the decedent&#x2019; s fuzzy sweater served to block this backspattered blood, capturing most ofthe droplets as they traveled back toward the shotgun&#x2019; s muzzle. Thus, regardless of the actual distance of the shotgun&#x2019; s muzzle or the shooter&#x2019; s face from the victim&#x2019; s back, even at 20 to 36 inches, no backspattered blood would be evident in this case. This demonstrates a common exception to the so-called rule, or generalization, that backspattered blood <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_166" aria-label=" Page 166. "/>will always provide information about muzzle-to-target distances involved in any shooting. The cookie-cutter method doesn&#x2019; t always cut it.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, the data developed here help our additional scientific efforts to understand the shooting. We have no reason to use the backspattered blood to determine muzzle-to-target distances. First, we know that the droplets were blocked by the sweater, and second, we do not have the shotgun to examine for the presence of bloodstains. But we do have some reasons to think that the muzzle-to-target distance is greater than 36 inches. We observed no muzzle effluents on the back of the sweater either macro- scopically or microscopically: No gunshot residues, including no burned or unburned gun powder, and no shot shell talc are present on the sweater.</p>
<p class="indent">The entrance holes from the slug and two halves of the sabot, and the absence of gaseous renting, tearing, and burning of the sweater, suggest an intermediate range between the muzzle and the target rather than a close contact or near-contact gunshot wound of entrance. As the data develop, we begin to see connections among their characters and the inferences that they can license through the careful application of scientific method.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7_8">
<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_8">Scientific Inferences from the Suspect&#x2019; s Glasses</h2>
<p class="noindent">The focus of the state&#x2019; s scientific argument remains the bloodstains observed on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses. The claim that only a gunshot entrance wound can produce this high-velocity backspatter has at least been put on notice by the examination of the sweater in this case. Clearly the data from the sweater show that no backspatter from the entrance wounds could account for these stains. In addition, the data from the sweater show that the gunshot wound is at least an intermediate-range injury rather than a close-range or contact gunshot entrance wound. This also precludes the stains on the glasses originating from high-velocity backspatter.</p>
<p class="indent">When faced with a question of the possible origin of bloodstains, a scientific approach suggests some sort of testing or experimentation. When hypotheses are developed, they must be tested. In the cookie-cutter approach to science, merely suggesting some hypothesis to explain some data appears to be sufficient to confirm that hypothesis: These cookie cutters seem to be self-confirming. The small stains on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses suggest high-velocity backspatter, and the hypothesis of high-velocity backspatter is confirmed by the small stains appearing on the glasses.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, the natural sciences do not work that way. Hypotheses must be tested independently of their derivations, and the results can be used in various ways depending upon what the test or experiment is designed to accomplish. So experimental results can suggest revisions of the original hypotheses as tested, as well as potentially providing confirmations or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_167" aria-label=" Page 167. "/>refutations of these original hypotheses. If our hypothesis that the small stains on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses originate from high-velocity backspatter does not work, then what does? The suspect himself provides another hypothesis suitable for testing. The scientific method intellectually demands that such tests be conducted.</p>
<p class="indent">The suspect&#x2019; s account of his actions at the death scene included approaching the front of the body, bending over to touch her chest, finding that his hands became covered with blood, standing before the body for a second or two with his hands suspended in front of his own chest, and then shaking his hands in the air in an effort to remove the blood. He then wiped his hands on his jeans before he tried to use the telephone.</p>
<p class="indent">This suggests an alternative mechanism to account for the stains on the glasses. The potential virtue of the hypothesis holding that the stains on his glasses originate from blood shaken off his hands is that this hypothesis can also account for the stains observed on the front of the victim&#x2019; s sweater. According to this hypothesis, the drip stains came from blood falling from his hands as they were held in front of his own chest and over her sweater while the cast-off stains came from shaking his hands. I developed a simple test using similar glasses and my own blood (<a href="#fig7_9">see Figures 7.9 and 7.10</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">I drew 20 ml of my own blood and soaked it into a sponge surrounded by butcher paper on the lab floor. I put on the glasses. I squatted down, putting both hands on the blood-soaked sponge. I stood up with my hands suspended in front of my chest, letting the blood drip from my hands onto the butcher paper. I then simply looked down at the sponge on the floor and shook my hands. The observations successfully replicated the drip and castoff bloodstains on both the front of the sweater and the suspect&#x2019; s glasses (<a href="#fig7_11">see Figures 7.11</a>through<a href="#fig7_18"> 7.18</a>).</p>

<p class="figcaption"><b>Figure 7.13 adn 7.14</b><span class="space"/>This slide shows an interesting characteristic of blood. Notice the small white spot of blood&#x2014;it is 1.3 mm of blood. However, look closely behind it; you will see the original blood spot, which is 2.2 mm&#x2014;almost twice as big. As the big spot dried, it shrunk and left the smaller spot behind. The reason this happened is that the serum separates from the red cells and evaporates. The red cells then clump together and clot. The 1.3 mm spot is that clot of red cells. The photo on the bottom shows how small these stains are. (Remember my pen-cil lead example.) These are the smallest blood spots on the defendant&#x2019;s</p></figcaption>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_168" aria-label=" Page 168. "/>The more data that the hypothesis consistently accounts for, in general, the more reliable the hypothesis becomes. The foundation for this lies in theories of truth, a province of the philosophical discipline known as episte- mology, or theory of knowledge. The relevant point is that if the hypothesis is in fact true, then at the very least, all other facts in the world are logically consistent with that hypothesis.</p>

"/>The spots in <a href="#fig7_17">Figure 7.17</a> range from .9 to .02 mm in size and they are remarkably similar in size. In fact, there is no relevant difference between these spots and the spots on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses.</p>
<p class="indent">As the reader can see, the spots are identical to the spots on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses and my test glasses spots were <i>not</i> produced by high-velocity backspatter from a gunshot. They were produced only by shaking bloody hands. There are other ways to produce small spots than high-velocity backspatter, as my experiment has shown. The conclusion, then, is that the spots on the defendant&#x2019; s glasses could have been produced by hand shaking, the way I produced these spots on the test glasses. This is exactly what the suspect reported doing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_172" aria-label=" Page 172. "/>The assertion that bloodstains as small as 1 mm <i>must</i> result from a gunshot is simply proven to be false by this experiment. The steps involved in developing the hypothesis that hand shaking could explain the stains on the glasses involved microscopic examination of the glasses, in turn showing that some of the stains were indeed larger than 1 mm before they dried. The method of proposing, developing, and testing this hypothesis produced results that not only confirmed that such hand shaking <i>could</i> account for the stains on the suspect&#x2019; s glasses, but also has the added bonus of accounting for the stains observed on the front of the victim&#x2019; s sweater.</p>

<h2 class="chsubhead" id="sec7_9">Scientific Conclusions about the Shooting Events</h2>
<p class="noindent">The dependence of good natural science upon data and its cogent development cannot be overemphasized. The state&#x2019; s reconstruction suffers from multiple instances of systematically ignoring significant data. For example, in addition to the problem of flawed bloodstain pattern analysis, if the suspect arrived home when witnesses indicated, and if he did the things that he stated, immediately phoning 911 when arriving at the neighbor&#x2019; s home, and if, as we do know, he stayed on the phone until police arrived, how then did he have time to stage the scene, hide the murder weapon, and dispose of the missing items from the home, let alone find time to shoot the victim? These questions must be raised. Once raised, they require at the very least some effort to provide synoptic answers.</p>
<p class="indent">The shotgun was never found despite an extensive search. Nor were the items missing from the home. Such data cannot be systematically ignored just because a cookie-cutter-covering law-like generalization suggests a solution to the case that is independent of these facts. Such pseudoscientific generalizations must never be taken at face value&#x2014;  doing so betrays the very essence of scientific method and flies in the face of its successful practice.</p>
<p class="indent">A crime scene reconstruction remains only as reliable as the sciences applied to the data. The sciences applied to the data are only as reliable as the completeness of the recognized, collected, documented, and preserved data. And the data can only be developed through the natural sciences, applied according to the scientific method, which distinguishes reliable scientific inferences from prejudices, lucky guesses, and mere random chance.</p>

"><sup>*</sup>According to one bloodstain classification taxonomy, stains are distinguished as being either low velocity (mostly large stains), medium velocity (mostly stains greater than 1 mm in diameter), or high velocity (stains 1 mm or less in diameter) in nature. This terminology, while still used, has lost favor with most scientifically trained bloodstain pattern analysts since it is inaccurate, imprecise, and not clearly descriptive. The energy applied to the blood source to produce blood spatter rather than some vague notion of a droplet&#x2019;s velocity (a vector) is not adequately accounted for by distinguishing low-, medium-, and high-velocity stains.</a></aside>

"><sup>*</sup> This method, if one could call the approach a method, precludes essential elements of what we refer to today as the scientific method. In what I have called the cookie-cutter approach to crime scene data, the science appears in the form of &#x201C;wise sayings,&#x201D; which function scientifically to inform us about the data. (This can even be taught as a form of deductive reasoning.) Sometimes this approach results in the correct answer, but if one recalls one&#x2019;s early scientific training, it makes none of the correct scientific methods evi-dent. That is why, presumably, we were asked to &#x201C;show our work&#x201D; when solving chemis-try, physics, or mathematics problems. The right answer, without supporting reasons, is scientifically meaningless. As I recall my own scientific education, some students even got the right answer by copying from other students who coincidentally had derived the correct answer. The method of copying, however, is not to be confused with any scien-tific method of computation being measured through the work.</a></aside>

Usually small bloodstains inside the gun&#x2019;s barrel originate from this phenomenon rather than from backspatter alone. I use Mikrosil cast-ing material applied inside the gun&#x2019;s barrel to document and recover such bloodstains, if present.</aside>
